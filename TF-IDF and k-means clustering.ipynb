However, I was so anxious about this car seat after reading the negative reviews that we went to the Peg Perego outlet in Ft. Wayne, IN to see the item for ourselves before committing.  We loved it! When we got the new items home, we could not figure out how to latch and unlatch the car seat, or how to attach it to the pliko switch stroller we bought.  The instructions were poor, had no words (only pictures), and we were so frustrated.  I was ready to take everything back and call it quits.  However, once we played around with the seat a bit (this took a few hours and a lot of patience) and figured out how to latch/unlatch/adjust it, we realized how simple and easy the whole thing is! And as a plus, it fits so nicely with the pliko switch stroller (which we LOVE). I adore that this car seat fits up to 30lbs, as pretty much every other seat I found only went to 22lbs.  The seat is heavier than other car seats, but it isn't cheap graco-quality plastic and actually feels like it has some durability to it.  I have pathetic upper body strength and even I can carry it around without much of a problem.  In any case, the seat isn't anywhere near heavy enough to warrant the serious doubts I had based on many of the reviews here.  The product gets a 5 for quality and style, and a 3 for ease of instruction, which average to a 4.  Also, if you live close to the outlet it is definitely worth a visit--- their prices are much lower and they offer the 2011 models plus have a good return policy.</td>\n",

       "78644   I had been searching everywhere for a car seat-- I absolutely HATED the cheap flimsy plastic ones that seem to be everywhere, and I fell in love with Peg because of the sleek design and great safety ratings.  However, I was so anxious about this car seat after reading the negative reviews that we went to the Peg Perego outlet in Ft. Wayne, IN to see the item for ourselves before committing.  We loved it! When we got the new items home, we could not figure out how to latch and unlatch the car seat, or how to attach it to the pliko switch stroller we bought.  The instructions were poor, had no words (only pictures), and we were so frustrated.  I was ready to take everything back and call it quits.  However, once we played around with the seat a bit (this took a few hours and a lot of patience) and figured out how to latch/unlatch/adjust it, we realized how simple and easy the whole thing is! And as a plus, it fits so nicely with the pliko switch stroller (which we LOVE). I adore that this car seat fits up to 30lbs, as pretty much every other seat I found only went to 22lbs.  The seat is heavier than other car seats, but it isn't cheap graco-quality plastic and actually feels like it has some durability to it.  I have pathetic upper body strength and even I can carry it around without much of a problem.  In any case, the seat isn't anywhere near heavy enough to warrant the serious doubts I had based on many of the reviews here.  The product gets a 5 for quality and style, and a 3 for ease of instruction, which average to a 4.  Also, if you live close to the outlet it is definitely worth a visit--- their prices are much lower and they offer the 2011 models plus have a good return policy.   \n",
       "93715   My toddler loves this toy.  She can't turn the crank yet, but waits for the bear to pop up when someone else turns it.  Then she hugs it and tries to &#34;free it&#34; from the box.

And she really just delights in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "120860  This is such a great and amazing buy for mommies to cut their little one's nails. I have been using this for 6 month now and NOT once did I hurt my baby.

       "162512  Wanted a natural nail polish. And this is the closest anyone makes. I love how it makes my natural nails look beautiful. Don't have to worry when it starts chipping because you barely notice. Made my nails a lot less yellow. Love this product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "35418   I purchased these because I wanted a liner that would help prevent staining on my expensive diapers.  I wasn't expecting these to act as a doubler.  (They definitely would NOT work for extra absorbency by the way.)  They do the trick for keeping my diapers stain free and make messy clean-ups easier.They are a low-cost in comparison to other liners, so that is a plus.  They're not as soft as I'd like them to be and mine shrank quite a bit, but they're a decent product for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "132678  This thing must have gone to heck and back before it came to my doorstep. Two of the bars were bent during shipping, stripping the finish off the metal. One of the connecting thingies was broken so we had to leave off one of the panels. By some miracle we still got it on the wall. Since we did, I was not going to wait for a replacement piece. Anyway, we got it on, it looks great, we fixed the bent bars, and our kitchen is now baby free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "51895   This Diaper Genie really works well, although it's my first diaper disposal unit so I don't have anything to compare it to. What I like about it is that it contains the diaper smell and only requires one-hand for operation: step on the pedal, the top lifts up, drop in the diaper and release the foot pedal. Swoosh - smelly diaper is gone. I do sometimes wish the opening was a bit bigger. As others noted, the refill cartridges are expensive. I bought this at Target for about $10 more than the Amazon price (I needed it in a hurry).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "82814   I got this, being a 'goth mom', I  was so excited to find a stroller that was black and red AND had skulls on it! It is compact (to fit in my MINI Cooper too). The skulls are only on the 'sun screen&#34;  But thats OK. The stroller is also a decent stroller to use too. I didn't know that the canvas 'caddy' on the back also came with it.Nice for a bottle of water and your smart phone. There is a small basket underneath. Not very deep, but I wasn't expecting it. I could fit a blanket and my purse under there.

       "75834   I was originally being ghetto and used a sports bra and made holes, but it didn't work very well haha. Before going back to work, I decided to purchase this. I am a petite person with small bust (34C while I'm breastfeeding - previously a B) and the size small works perfectly for me. It's not loose or anything. It keeps the suction cups in place and I can type emails while pumping, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

I read in other reviews before purchasing that the stackable screw-on containers were a difficult to screw on and off, I found that to be the case in the beginning but found out that you need to align the layer right on top of the bottom before screwing on.On days when I am not too sure how long I will be out I use all four containers, on days when I'm out only for a couple of hours I fill up only 1 layer and take it with me- having it in my diaper bag just incase really gives me a peace of mind as well. The funnel top makes it very easy to pour into bottles without any mess, I have found that when the bottle is filled to the top with water it can be very hard to pour all that formula powder into it but this would be the case whether you are using this dispenser or not, the trick is to simply use a big bottle opposed to the small bottle.Thus far the dispenser has served me well and I have no real complaints about it. I love it! And it would make a great snack container too when baby get old enough to actually eat them.</td>\n",

       "126212  I didn't really begin to use the Piyo Piyo 4-layer milk powder dispenser until my baby became exclusively formula fed. It is one of the greatest inventions for moms! I read in other reviews before purchasing that the stackable screw-on containers were a difficult to screw on and off, I found that to be the case in the beginning but found out that you need to align the layer right on top of the bottom before screwing on.On days when I am not too sure how long I will be out I use all four containers, on days when I'm out only for a couple of hours I fill up only 1 layer and take it with me- having it in my diaper bag just incase really gives me a peace of mind as well. The funnel top makes it very easy to pour into bottles without any mess, I have found that when the bottle is filled to the top with water it can be very hard to pour all that formula powder into it but this would be the case whether you are using this dispenser or not, the trick is to simply use a big bottle opposed to the small bottle.Thus far the dispenser has served me well and I have no real complaints about it. I love it! And it would make a great snack container too when baby get old enough to actually eat them.   \n",

       "127474  We bought this carseat for our second car. We wanted a more \"portable\" choice then our primary car seat. The seat has all the promised features. It is very easy to install and uninstall. We yet have to test how easy it folds and can be carried. It is on the heavy side, so I don't see how it can be carried on the back.Also, it is not as cushy and comfortable as the bigger carseats. But my son stayed in it for 5 hours drive and he didn't complain :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "15720   The Philips AVENT Bottle Brush  has a thick cluster of bristles at the end which really help with scrubbing out the bottom of the bottles. I soak my bottles in a large bowl using a combo of vinegar, baking soda, and water after which I use the brush to clean out the bottles, and the result is squeaky clean bottles and parts. The back of the brush has a short groove running down the center which my finger rests on when I'm using it to clean, it's a small detail but I notice that it makes it more comfortable to use. I'm really happy with this purchase!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "      <td>I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&amp;eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&amp;eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.</td>\n",

       "184872  I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.   \n",

       "169574  It initially does appear to give your hair a fuller look.  However, on closer look, it mainly falls to the scalp.  I didn't have problems with sweat or it staining my clothing, etc, but I didn't use it for too long for fear that people would notice that my scalp appeared black.  I have a slightly fuller head than typical guys that are looking at this product, but my hair is thin, and my scalp does show in brighter lighting.  I was hoping this product could disguise that.  In a sense, it does on passing glance or from a distance.  I have not had the courage to try it at work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "168717  I have used this Jane Iredale product now for 6 years.  Once introduced to it I fell in love with the appearance it gives your skin.  Does not flake or look drying on the skin.  Use with the stamping brush (bought separately) and stipple it onto your face with this brush.  It leaves no residue and makes your skin look like porcelain.  Just make sure you get the right color shade for your skin.  I am fair skin and this works great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds. But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up. There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!  If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter), then the monitor is pretty crystal clear. The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!). So, if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night, or every other night, then I guess this monitor would be okay. But if you have that kind of money, I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one. I think I am going to return this for something a little better.  I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually have such great quality products. I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.  My suggestion: don't [spend] your money on this monitor.</td>\n",

I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument.</td>\n",

When it arrived it was way to small.  I could not close the front.  I also reviewed how it is set up and it basically holds the pumps to your breast, so you don't want it too tight.  It could easily form a clogged duct with the amount of pressure if it was too tight.  So, I emailed the company and requested a return, I explained that I felt the sizing chart was off.  The company accepted my suggustion, said they would take a look at the sizing chart and they accepted my return.  I am giving 4 stars not for the product, I would give 3 stars especially for the price.  I'm sure this did not nearly cost this much to make, even if it is imported.  We design and import organic bibs and the mark up is a little greedy if you ask me, but I believe there is a certain percentage that Amazon needs to take.  However, I am giving it 4 stars for customer service.  Thanks for accepting my return.</td>\n",

They feel kind of alien right now, as it's the first time I've ever wore finger picks, but I'll get used to them eventually :P.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "4781    This monitor is decent for the price, I guess. But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better. The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds. But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up. There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!  If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter), then the monitor is pretty crystal clear. The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!). So, if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night, or every other night, then I guess this monitor would be okay. But if you have that kind of money, I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one. I think I am going to return this for something a little better.  I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually have such great quality products. I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.  My suggestion: don't [spend] your money on this monitor.   \n",
       "197360  The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "78856   I ordered this off of amazon due to the reviews it has received.  I read the sizing chart and ordered according to the companies recommendations.  When it arrived it was way to small.  I could not close the front.  I also reviewed how it is set up and it basically holds the pumps to your breast, so you don't want it too tight.  It could easily form a clogged duct with the amount of pressure if it was too tight.  So, I emailed the company and requested a return, I explained that I felt the sizing chart was off.  The company accepted my suggustion, said they would take a look at the sizing chart and they accepted my return.  I am giving 4 stars not for the product, I would give 3 stars especially for the price.  I'm sure this did not nearly cost this much to make, even if it is imported.  We design and import organic bibs and the mark up is a little greedy if you ask me, but I believe there is a certain percentage that Amazon needs to take.  However, I am giving it 4 stars for customer service.  Thanks for accepting my return.                                                                                               \n",

We may try again in a few months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "82572   My baby loves this!  He likes all the different textures and colors and will play for ten minutes at a time (that's forever for a six-month-old) with his dragon.

       "131116  Our daughter loves this. Yes, it's a little pricey, but it's worth it because we are so much less likely to lose this one versus others (which somehow find themselves rolling into the driveway, under the restaurant table, etc.). Stands up well when you wash the whole thing, which was a big selling point for me. I like this one because a couple kids at her daycare have them but nobody had the pink bear but my girl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds. But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up. There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!  If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter), then the monitor is pretty crystal clear. The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!). So, if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night, or every other night, then I guess this monitor would be okay. But if you have that kind of money, I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one. I think I am going to return this for something a little better.  I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually have such great quality products. I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.

       "4781    This monitor is decent for the price, I guess. But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better. The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds. But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up. There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!  If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter), then the monitor is pretty crystal clear. The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!). So, if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night, or every other night, then I guess this monitor would be okay. But if you have that kind of money, I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one. I think I am going to return this for something a little better.  I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually have such great quality products. I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.  My suggestion: don't [spend] your money on this monitor.   \n",

Let me tell you, he just loved it from the moment we put him in! He would just laugh and laugh and push off with his feet like crazy.I think we ejoy watching him in it more than him. I love the brake pads feature which prevent the walker from going over any changes in flooring, like stairs or a door jam. I actually took them off, as our house is only one story, and I am always near to him while he is in it.THe little piano tray is excellent, and has such a variety of sounds and songs that he can make. THey are not too annoying or shrill sounding, either, like so many childrens toys.It was not too hard to put together, although i did need to follow the manual pretty closely, as I could not figure out the pieces on my own. I think it probably took about 20 minutes to get all set up.I like that the music tray is removeable, so it can become a tray for little toys or even snacks later on.I wold highly recommend this toy, as my son seems to like it very much</td>\n",

       "138288  I started letting my son play in this walker when he was about 4 months old. He would lean forward because he was still needing support to sit upright, so I started rolling up a towel or blanket and putting it between his chest and the walker. Let me tell you, he just loved it from the moment we put him in! He would just laugh and laugh and push off with his feet like crazy.I think we ejoy watching him in it more than him. I love the brake pads feature which prevent the walker from going over any changes in flooring, like stairs or a door jam. I actually took them off, as our house is only one story, and I am always near to him while he is in it.THe little piano tray is excellent, and has such a variety of sounds and songs that he can make. THey are not too annoying or shrill sounding, either, like so many childrens toys.It was not too hard to put together, although i did need to follow the manual pretty closely, as I could not figure out the pieces on my own. I think it probably took about 20 minutes to get all set up.I like that the music tray is removeable, so it can become a tray for little toys or even snacks later on.I wold highly recommend this toy, as my son seems to like it very much   \n",

       "131116  Our daughter loves this. Yes, it's a little pricey, but it's worth it because we are so much less likely to lose this one versus others (which somehow find themselves rolling into the driveway, under the restaurant table, etc.). Stands up well when you wash the whole thing, which was a big selling point for me. I like this one because a couple kids at her daycare have them but nobody had the pink bear but my girl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

You have to wash it several times, braid it... just really mess it up to &#34;break it in&#34; or its practically useless.It's still not completely broken in for us but we have wrapped 2x with it now and the first time was a complete FLOP.The second time we did a reinforced ruck tied tibetan, it worked better but the wrap itself is still hard to work w/ it because of the gauze material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "      <td>We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.</td>\n",

       "15720   The Philips AVENT Bottle Brush  has a thick cluster of bristles at the end which really help with scrubbing out the bottom of the bottles. I soak my bottles in a large bowl using a combo of vinegar, baking soda, and water after which I use the brush to clean out the bottles, and the result is squeaky clean bottles and parts. The back of the brush has a short groove running down the center which my finger rests on when I'm using it to clean, it's a small detail but I notice that it makes it more comfortable to use. I'm really happy with this purchase!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "70779   We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.   \n",

I thought the leaks were normal. Now that we are in regular sized diapers I know that the leaks were not normal. The seams around the legs seem like they are unfinished so that the inner fabric touches whatever baby is wearing or sitting on. So even if the diaper doesn't drip pee it will always seep it. Some days (and often) baby went through a new change of clothes with every diaper change. The first time I just used one outfit all day long I thought it was a miracle. But no, thats how the diapers should work! I stripped the diapers and everything, but they always leaked. I currently use bigger size GroVia diapers along with several other brands and don't have a leak problem. It is obviously specific to the make and fit of the NEWBORN diapers. Horrible.We only bought GroVia brand for the newborn sized diapers. We currently use several brands of one-size diapers. I HIGHLY recommend buying several brands of both newborn and one-size diapers. The one-size can be too huge on a newborn. Its nice to have something that fits better for the first month or two. But GroVia newborn diapers leaked like crazy for us. I'll try them again with baby two, but am definitely buying another brand's newborn diapers next time!</td>\n",

The one-size can be too huge on a newborn. Its nice to have something that fits better for the first month or two. But GroVia newborn diapers leaked like crazy for us. I'll try them again with baby two, but am definitely buying another brand's newborn diapers next time!   \n",

These locks work great, as there is no external hardware. Now my son simply tries to open a cabinet and walks away when he realizes that it doesn't open.  There are two swithes on the lock that keep them locked or unlocked.  That works well when you don't want your cabinet to be locked at all times or if someone needs to babyproof their house on occasion, but not all of the time. I just stick the key to my fridge (magnet) so I won't lose it.  It does take some getting used to, as you can't see the lock from the outside of the cabinet to remind you it is there, but it sure does beat having to mess with external locks while trying to get into your cabinet.  I also like that the cabinet won't open the slightest bit while being pulled on, which keeps my son's fingers from getting pinched.  I would highly recommend this product.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My rating is more of 3.5 than 4.I already own a Britax b-Agile stroller which is a very lightweight (16 pounds; lightest in its class outside of umbrella strollers) stroller costing around $200.The experience of the product undoubtedly begins with its box and then continues with the packaging, manual and finally the product.  Please see the box and manual review at the end.---------------------------STROLLER---------------------------Main day-to-day issues and design letdowns:- Reclining adjuster constantly gets stuck very easily as other reviews have indicated.  Why other strollers could do it and Bumbleride screwed it up I don't know.  I compared it to the Britax mechanism, but since it is not easily serviceable I couldn't open it to see exactly how it works.  Nevertheless it seems both work on the same principle but the Britax mechanism probably features better springs and better tolerances to allow the lock to properly disengage and reengage.- Brake hard to disengage - The brake is very stiff and hard to disengage.  If your child is sleeping there is a high likelihood of waking him up.- Manual stroller locks to keep stroller folded - These things are completely abysmal, very hard to put on and hard to remove and do not belong on the stroller for this price.CONS- Some sort of properly working adapter or pump should have been included with Indie.  I spent inordinate amount of time already searching for something that is very specialized because of Indie's wheel design.  None of the bike bumps that I had, nor any store pumps will fit nicely to Indie's wheels.  The problem is the clearance between the stem (pointing upward) and the hubcap is very small.  Now on some strollers the stem on the wheels angles outward instead of pointing vertically upward thus alleviating this problem.  Not so on Indie.  I visited 3 bike shops, RIE, Target, Toys 'R US and still couldn't find a properly fitting solution.  Now I found a special adapter (through Bob strollers) called Topeak Pressure-Rite Anti-Air Loss Connector which should alleviate the clearance problem.  However, either my adapter was defective or I was not doing something right - I couldn't successfully pump up the tires using it.- Once assembled the upper part of the frame connected to the handle wobbles.  This is due to the folding mechanism and the latching mechanism being somewhat loose.  I'm not sure if this is considered negligible, done on purpose to help with suspension or a design flaw that will impact frame durability.- The handle material is foam instead of rubber- The canopy adjustment is very stiff.  When we tried it out in the store side-by-side with City Elite the entire stroller moved back whereas the City Elite had very smooth collapsing mechanism.- The handle adjusts to different angles but the increments are too far apart.  I would have loved to be able to set the handle in a certain position but it would only lock in a position lower or much higher.- No automatic lock for folding.  The manual plastic locks are very stiff and inconvenient to put on.- Folded profile - the stroller remains big and bulky especially height-wise.- Brake at least initially is hard to engage and disengage.  In addition sometimes there is not audible click to let you know it is locked/unlocked.- No front wheel suspension.  The suspension on the front is the pneumatic tire itself.- The tires could be fatter.- Somewhat awkward fold and unfold.  Requires two steps.PROS- No strong chemical smells once opened (apart from rubber smell from the wheels)- Only 20 lbs for the entire stroller.  Remove the rear wheels and you are looking at around 15-16 lbs.- High quality materials in the frame and fabrics- Huge canopy- The seat is made of high quality materials and is nicely padded on the back and on the sides.  There was no chemical smell once opened.- The seat is easy to put on and remove- The seat reclines almost flat- The seat position is among the highest among other strollers- Adjustable leg rest to many different positions- The stroller pushes easily----------------------------BOX AND MANUAL - MY GRADE D----------------------------The Indie's box is underwhelming to say the least for the stroller costing $500+ dollars.  It is just a grey run-of-the mill box with some black text and stroller outline.  My Britax stroller on the other hand came in a very high quality box with multi-color graphics.  Alas some high-end professional equipment comes in a rather plain boxes so we can forgive Bumbleride for this.The Indie's manual on the other hand cannot be forgiven.  It is terrible for the stroller in any price range but for the stroller costing that much it is outrageously cheaply made, poorly thought out, poorly organized and poorly executed.  It is simply incomparable to the b-Agile manual made on high quality paper, using offset printing and clearly diagrammed and laid out.The Indie's manual is B/W and was most probably made on a copy machine.  The accompanying pictures are terrible - they are small B/W photographs(!!!) with screwed up contrast levels and as a result you cannot see anything on some pictures because all the details are collapsed to uniformly black color.  The quality of the manual is in a complete dissonance with the quality of the stroller itself. It seems that Bumbleride ran out of money from the development budget and the manual was concocted in a couple of hours by some person answering the phones, packing the boxes there and also doing Indie's manual in his spare time.The manual organization is a prime example of how NOT to devise instruction manuals.  It is divided into separate picture section and a separate text instruction section.  So you have to constantly flip back and forth to understand the entire instructions.Luckily the stroller itself is mostly nicely engineered and thought out and you can assemble it without referring to the manual too much.=========================CONCLUSION=========================Is this THE only stroller you should own?  I would disagree.  And if you do, you simply do not know how much simplicity you are missing out.  I believe there are two many negatives in this stroller to have this stroller as the only all-around stroller especially connected to folding/unfolding it and it's bulky profile.  But then our goal was to add all-terrain and smoother ride capability for going to long walks on sidewalks and less than perfect trails to our existing B-Agile stroller lacking those things.When going out into urban environment with lot of ins and outs from the car I would without any hesitation pick my B-Agile stroller.  But for a long walk in a park...well..that's another story.</td>\n",

       "110278  My son was obsessed with our exterior door baby locks and kept pulling them off as soon as he saw that one was loose or unlocked.  These locks work great, as there is no external hardware. Now my son simply tries to open a cabinet and walks away when he realizes that it doesn't open.  There are two swithes on the lock that keep them locked or unlocked.  That works well when you don't want your cabinet to be locked at all times or if someone needs to babyproof their house on occasion, but not all of the time. I just stick the key to my fridge (magnet) so I won't lose it.  It does take some getting used to, as you can't see the lock from the outside of the cabinet to remind you it is there, but it sure does beat having to mess with external locks while trying to get into your cabinet.  I also like that the cabinet won't open the slightest bit while being pulled on, which keeps my son's fingers from getting pinched.  I would highly recommend this product.

       "137063  My rating is more of 3.5 than 4.I already own a Britax b-Agile stroller which is a very lightweight (16 pounds; lightest in its class outside of umbrella strollers) stroller costing around $200.The experience of the product undoubtedly begins with its box and then continues with the packaging, manual and finally the product.  Please see the box and manual review at the end.---------------------------STROLLER---------------------------Main day-to-day issues and design letdowns:- Reclining adjuster constantly gets stuck very easily as other reviews have indicated.  Why other strollers could do it and Bumbleride screwed it up I don't know.  I compared it to the Britax mechanism, but since it is not easily serviceable I couldn't open it to see exactly how it works.  Nevertheless it seems both work on the same principle but the Britax mechanism probably features better springs and better tolerances to allow the lock to properly disengage and reengage.- Brake hard to disengage - The brake is very stiff and hard to disengage.  If your child is sleeping there is a high likelihood of waking him up.- Manual stroller locks to keep stroller folded - These things are completely abysmal, very hard to put on and hard to remove and do not belong on the stroller for this price.CONS- Some sort of properly working adapter or pump should have been included with Indie.  I spent inordinate amount of time already searching for something that is very specialized because of Indie's wheel design.  None of the bike bumps that I had, nor any store pumps will fit nicely to Indie's wheels.  The problem is the clearance between the stem (pointing upward) and the hubcap is very small.  Now on some strollers the stem on the wheels angles outward instead of pointing vertically upward thus alleviating this problem.  Not so on Indie.  I visited 3 bike shops, RIE, Target, Toys 'R US and still couldn't find a properly fitting solution.  Now I found a special adapter (through Bob strollers) called Topeak Pressure-Rite Anti-Air Loss Connector which should alleviate the clearance problem.  However, either my adapter was defective or I was not doing something right - I couldn't successfully pump up the tires using it.- Once assembled the upper part of the frame connected to the handle wobbles.  This is due to the folding mechanism and the latching mechanism being somewhat loose.  I'm not sure if this is considered negligible, done on purpose to help with suspension or a design flaw that will impact frame durability.- The handle material is foam instead of rubber- The canopy adjustment is very stiff.  When we tried it out in the store side-by-side with City Elite the entire stroller moved back whereas the City Elite had very smooth collapsing mechanism.- The handle adjusts to different angles but the increments are too far apart.  I would have loved to be able to set the handle in a certain position but it would only lock in a position lower or much higher.- No automatic lock for folding.  The manual plastic locks are very stiff and inconvenient to put on.- Folded profile - the stroller remains big and bulky especially height-wise.- Brake at least initially is hard to engage and disengage.  In addition sometimes there is not audible click to let you know it is locked/unlocked.- No front wheel suspension.  The suspension on the front is the pneumatic tire itself.- The tires could be fatter.- Somewhat awkward fold and unfold.  Requires two steps.PROS- No strong chemical smells once opened (apart from rubber smell from the wheels)- Only 20 lbs for the entire stroller.  Remove the rear wheels and you are looking at around 15-16 lbs.- High quality materials in the frame and fabrics- Huge canopy- The seat is made of high quality materials and is nicely padded on the back and on the sides.  There was no chemical smell once opened.- The seat is easy to put on and remove- The seat reclines almost flat- The seat position is among the highest among other strollers- Adjustable leg rest to many different positions- The stroller pushes easily----------------------------BOX AND MANUAL - MY GRADE D----------------------------The Indie's box is underwhelming to say the least for the stroller costing $500+ dollars.  It is just a grey run-of-the mill box with some black text and stroller outline.  My Britax stroller on the other hand came in a very high quality box with multi-color graphics.  Alas some high-end professional equipment comes in a rather plain boxes so we can forgive Bumbleride for this.The Indie's manual on the other hand cannot be forgiven.  It is terrible for the stroller in any price range but for the stroller costing that much it is outrageously cheaply made, poorly thought out, poorly organized and poorly executed.  It is simply incomparable to the b-Agile manual made on high quality paper, using offset printing and clearly diagrammed and laid out.The Indie's manual is B/W and was most probably made on a copy machine.  The accompanying pictures are terrible - they are small B/W photographs(!!!) with screwed up contrast levels and as a result you cannot see anything on some pictures because all the details are collapsed to uniformly black color.  The quality of the manual is in a complete dissonance with the quality of the stroller itself. It seems that Bumbleride ran out of money from the development budget and the manual was concocted in a couple of hours by some person answering the phones, packing the boxes there and also doing Indie's manual in his spare time.The manual organization is a prime example of how NOT to devise instruction manuals.  It is divided into separate picture section and a separate text instruction section.  So you have to constantly flip back and forth to understand the entire instructions.Luckily the stroller itself is mostly nicely engineered and thought out and you can assemble it without referring to the manual too much.=========================CONCLUSION=========================Is this THE only stroller you should own?  I would disagree.  And if you do, you simply do not know how much simplicity you are missing out.  I believe there are two many negatives in this stroller to have this stroller as the only all-around stroller especially connected to folding/unfolding it and it's bulky profile.  But then our goal was to add all-terrain and smoother ride capability for going to long walks on sidewalks and less than perfect trails to our existing B-Agile stroller lacking those things.When going out into urban environment with lot of ins and outs from the car I would without any hesitation pick my B-Agile stroller.  But for a long walk in a park...well..that's another story.   \n",
       "9154    I took the booster seat out of the box & put the strap over my should & the strap broke loose from the base. Looks like the thread used to seal the strap into the base broke free. I had to redo the strap & secure it.Poor quality to have it break 5 mins out of the box.

       "      <td>I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&amp;eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&amp;eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.</td>\n",

Use with the stamping brush (bought separately) and stipple it onto your face with this brush.  It leaves no residue and makes your skin look like porcelain.  Just make sure you get the right color shade for your skin.  I am fair skin and this works great.</td>\n",

The tint was perfect for me and the makeup looked so good.  It wasn't messy or difficult to put on.  It wore well throughout the day and since it's summer, oil from my skin didn't break through and look greasy.  I didn't need any more powder than the amount I put on in the morning after I apply foundation.  Great makeup l definitely buy again.</td>\n",

I have used products from companies such as Lancome, Algenist, Christian Dior, La Prairie, Fresh, Chanel, L'Occitaine, Vichy, Tarte, L'Oreal, Olay, Aubrey Organics, Peter Lamas, and quite a few others. I have used products which are not natural in base and others which are all natural in base.  Every product promises to deliver smooth skin, firm youthful changes, wrinkles smoothed, and a variety of other anti-aging or healthy skin promises.\\n\\nSome of these products are stunning and work very quickly.  Other products take more time to begin to show- sometimes several purchases of product to get there.  Still other products never really do seem to deliver what they promise.\\n\\nWhen it comes to skin care, let's be honest here.  Not everyone reacts the same way to products.  That means that what works for me might not work for you.  However, as a makeup artist, I work with a variety of skin types, so I test and use products with not just my own skin in mind.\\n\\nWHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?\\nSkin &amp; Co Truffle Therapy cream comes in an amber jar with a gold lid.  The lid has a single liner in it (shiny cardboard) but does not have an inner lid that can be replaced like so many other brands do.  This only has a foam liner which peels off for the first use and you don't put it back.  It gets too messy.  The cream itself is medium in texture.  It is not thick and it is not runny.  It is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe cream has a definite coconut fragrance that is reminiscent of beach suntan lotions.  It also has a smokey tinge to it which is most likely from the truffles in it.  There are also \"cones\" (like dimethicone) which help to make the skin feel smoother.  Also there is no SPF in this cream which I am very happy about.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I will wear what I want.  If I don't want sunscreen, I don't want to be forced to wear it.\\n\\nONE SMALL PROBLEM\\nWhen I received this cream, I found it had leaked all over the jar and box.  Not too much was lost, but for the price, it was a bit frustrating to find it arriving like that.  It could be because it is summer and when it was shipped, perhaps it was in a hot location which caused this- as is very possible with many products when it is very hot out.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CREAM\\nI recently wrote a review on another Skin &amp; Co product that I tested&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;SKIN&amp;CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;.  At the time I did not have the cream nor did I know I would be testing it out.  So, when I tested this cream, I did it in a few ways.\\n\\nCREAM ALONE\\nI tested this cream alone without any serum of any kind under it.  My results were that the skin was smoothed and moisturized.  The level of moisture and smoothness, however, was not extraordinary.  The smoothness lasted most of the day and the moisture began to fade about mid afternoon.  I would say that this is medium to lightweight in nature when used alone.  I saw a gentle performance on the face, but nothing remarkable.\\n\\nCREAM AND SERUM\\nWhen I decided to compare the cream performance, I used it with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;SKIN&amp;CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the other side of my face and the difference was worth mentioning.  My skin felt MUCH smoother, MUCH more moisturized and the results lasted until the following morning.  I did see a bit more difference in the side where I used the cream with the serum.  My skin looked a little more glowy and a little more fresh and moisturized than the side with only the cream.  I also saw a light lift to the face as well.\\n\\nBoth uses leave the skin not greasy and it absorbs quickly, used with serum or not.  That is what makes it especially nice for summer.\\n\\nWHO IS THIS CREAM SUITED FOR?\\nI would say after my experience that this cream is great for summer use for even mature skin.  I am not sure about winter, as I am thinking that it might not be moisturizing enough for dry or mature skin.  There is no SPF in it WHICH I LOVE, so you can use whatever you want if you want sunscreen.  I would say that this cream is great for normal to oily skin (unless it is VERY oily) even in winter time.\\n\\nIf you have great needs for skin pick me up as far as wrinkles, brightness, sagging, and age spots, I don't think that this cream will be your miracle cream.  It is a good basic cream and when used with the serum, it is even nicer.  There is a light lift when used with the serum.  But it does not seem to reach the level of Lancome Absolue, Algenist Genius, Dior Capture or One or some of the other high end products which provide really quick differences within literally days.\\n\\nThis is more in line with the L'Occitaine, L'Oreal, Dior Hydra, Fresh, Aubrey Organics, and some of the other lines from the drugstore that I have tried that work nicely but not miraculously.\\n\\nThis Truffle Cream is definitely better than some skincare I have tried which did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\\nWhen used alone, this cream is a nice moisturizer for lightweight to medium moisture.  Not much change in the face (tested on a few faces with light lines and aging) but a little bit of a glow added and healthier look to the skin.  It is good to use under makeup as it provides a smooth finish, but it might not be enough for mature skin or very dry skin especially in winter.  It does absorb quite quickly leaving the skin ready and fresh for makeup in a good amount of time.\\n\\nUsed with the serum designed to go with it, the cream steps up a notch and I did see some mild changes to the skin which lasted a lot longer.  There is a glow with some line improvement on light lines leaving a nice glow to the skin. I also saw a light lift to the face after only a few days.  Again, however, with some people with aging signs and a need of a lot of lift and youthful appearance, this might not fit the bill for you.\\n\\nGreat for summer for most skin types and probably more for normal to lightly oily skin for winter, this cream (and serum too) are good for solid moisturizing, light anti aging benefits at a pretty good price compared to some lines of skin care.  It does have some natural ingredients in it.\\n\\nIf you find the scent of coconut at the beach not a positive thing, you might not like this.  It definitely has a coconut fragrance to it which has a deeper smokey tinge to it, and it does not fade fast.  This could be a problem for some, but for me, I have gotten used to it.  I actually like it for summer use.\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this four stars because I didn't see remarkable changes with it, but it is a good solid performer for moisturizing, light anti-aging  and lift benefits and skin care in the summer without sunscreen.  I wanted to really give it four and a half stars because even though it is not five stars, I still am thankful to have found a cream with no sunscreen in it that is good for summer and does a solid job of what it does do as listed above.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Oblagi sun shield with tint is rated at spf 50 providing excellent coverage for your sunbathing needs.  The addition of tint covers and blends evenly with most skin tones and does a good job that you may consider going makeup free for the day.  The product is very thin which is a good thing as it provides plenty of coverage without having to use to much.  The non greasy feel allows you to enjoy your day in the sun without feeling oily and uncomfortable.  The product itself is wonderful, but easily the most expensive that I have ever used.  For a large family this may not last more then several days especially after reapplying throughout the day.  To make the product last, you may consider only using this only for your face while using something less expensive for the rest of your body (or your family )  If cost is no object then this is certainly over if the most effective and useful sunscreens in the market.</td>\n",

       "184872  I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.

       "168717  I have used this Jane Iredale product now for 6 years.  Once introduced to it I fell in love with the appearance it gives your skin.  Does not flake or look drying on the skin.  Use with the stamping brush (bought separately) and stipple it onto your face with this brush.  It leaves no residue and makes your skin look like porcelain.  Just make sure you get the right color shade for your skin.  I am fair skin and this works great.

       "187359  Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation was thicker than I usually wear so that surprised me, but it went on smoothly and covered well.  The tint was perfect for me and the makeup looked so good.  It wasn't messy or difficult to put on.  It wore well throughout the day and since it's summer, oil from my skin didn't break through and look greasy.  I didn't need any more powder than the amount I put on in the morning after I apply foundation.  Great makeup l definitely buy again.

       "184946  (WARNING- THIS IS AN IN DEPTH REVIEW.  IF YOU WANT A QUICK SUMMARY, SEE THE BOTTOM LINE  SECTION AT THE END)\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to test out a wide variety of skin care products from all types of companies.  I have used products from companies such as Lancome, Algenist, Christian Dior, La Prairie, Fresh, Chanel, L'Occitaine, Vichy, Tarte, L'Oreal, Olay, Aubrey Organics, Peter Lamas, and quite a few others. I have used products which are not natural in base and others which are all natural in base.  Every product promises to deliver smooth skin, firm youthful changes, wrinkles smoothed, and a variety of other anti-aging or healthy skin promises.\\n\\nSome of these products are stunning and work very quickly.  Other products take more time to begin to show- sometimes several purchases of product to get there.  Still other products never really do seem to deliver what they promise.\\n\\nWhen it comes to skin care, let's be honest here.  Not everyone reacts the same way to products.  That means that what works for me might not work for you.  However, as a makeup artist, I work with a variety of skin types, so I test and use products with not just my own skin in mind.\\n\\nWHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?\\nSkin & Co Truffle Therapy cream comes in an amber jar with a gold lid.  The lid has a single liner in it (shiny cardboard) but does not have an inner lid that can be replaced like so many other brands do.  This only has a foam liner which peels off for the first use and you don't put it back.  It gets too messy.  The cream itself is medium in texture.  It is not thick and it is not runny.  It is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe cream has a definite coconut fragrance that is reminiscent of beach suntan lotions.  It also has a smokey tinge to it which is most likely from the truffles in it.  There are also \"cones\" (like dimethicone) which help to make the skin feel smoother.  Also there is no SPF in this cream which I am very happy about.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I will wear what I want.  If I don't want sunscreen, I don't want to be forced to wear it.\\n\\nONE SMALL PROBLEM\\nWhen I received this cream, I found it had leaked all over the jar and box.  Not too much was lost, but for the price, it was a bit frustrating to find it arriving like that.  It could be because it is summer and when it was shipped, perhaps it was in a hot location which caused this- as is very possible with many products when it is very hot out.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CREAM\\nI recently wrote a review on another Skin & Co product that I tested&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>.  At the time I did not have the cream nor did I know I would be testing it out.  So, when I tested this cream, I did it in a few ways.\\n\\nCREAM ALONE\\nI tested this cream alone without any serum of any kind under it.  My results were that the skin was smoothed and moisturized.  The level of moisture and smoothness, however, was not extraordinary.  The smoothness lasted most of the day and the moisture began to fade about mid afternoon.  I would say that this is medium to lightweight in nature when used alone.  I saw a gentle performance on the face, but nothing remarkable.\\n\\nCREAM AND SERUM\\nWhen I decided to compare the cream performance, I used it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;on the other side of my face and the difference was worth mentioning.  My skin felt MUCH smoother, MUCH more moisturized and the results lasted until the following morning.  I did see a bit more difference in the side where I used the cream with the serum.  My skin looked a little more glowy and a little more fresh and moisturized than the side with only the cream.  I also saw a light lift to the face as well.\\n\\nBoth uses leave the skin not greasy and it absorbs quickly, used with serum or not.  That is what makes it especially nice for summer.\\n\\nWHO IS THIS CREAM SUITED FOR?\\nI would say after my experience that this cream is great for summer use for even mature skin.  I am not sure about winter, as I am thinking that it might not be moisturizing enough for dry or mature skin.  There is no SPF in it WHICH I LOVE, so you can use whatever you want if you want sunscreen.  I would say that this cream is great for normal to oily skin (unless it is VERY oily) even in winter time.\\n\\nIf you have great needs for skin pick me up as far as wrinkles, brightness, sagging, and age spots, I don't think that this cream will be your miracle cream.  It is a good basic cream and when used with the serum, it is even nicer.  There is a light lift when used with the serum.  But it does not seem to reach the level of Lancome Absolue, Algenist Genius, Dior Capture or One or some of the other high end products which provide really quick differences within literally days.\\n\\nThis is more in line with the L'Occitaine, L'Oreal, Dior Hydra, Fresh, Aubrey Organics, and some of the other lines from the drugstore that I have tried that work nicely but not miraculously.\\n\\nThis Truffle Cream is definitely better than some skincare I have tried which did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\\nWhen used alone, this cream is a nice moisturizer for lightweight to medium moisture.  Not much change in the face (tested on a few faces with light lines and aging) but a little bit of a glow added and healthier look to the skin.  It is good to use under makeup as it provides a smooth finish, but it might not be enough for mature skin or very dry skin especially in winter.  It does absorb quite quickly leaving the skin ready and fresh for makeup in a good amount of time.\\n\\nUsed with the serum designed to go with it, the cream steps up a notch and I did see some mild changes to the skin which lasted a lot longer.  There is a glow with some line improvement on light lines leaving a nice glow to the skin. I also saw a light lift to the face after only a few days.  Again, however, with some people with aging signs and a need of a lot of lift and youthful appearance, this might not fit the bill for you.\\n\\nGreat for summer for most skin types and probably more for normal to lightly oily skin for winter, this cream (and serum too) are good for solid moisturizing, light anti aging benefits at a pretty good price compared to some lines of skin care.  It does have some natural ingredients in it.\\n\\nIf you find the scent of coconut at the beach not a positive thing, you might not like this.  It definitely has a coconut fragrance to it which has a deeper smokey tinge to it, and it does not fade fast.  This could be a problem for some, but for me, I have gotten used to it.  I actually like it for summer use.\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this four stars because I didn't see remarkable changes with it, but it is a good solid performer for moisturizing, light anti-aging  and lift benefits and skin care in the summer without sunscreen.  I wanted to really give it four and a half stars because even though it is not five stars, I still am thankful to have found a cream with no sunscreen in it that is good for summer and does a solid job of what it does do as listed above.   \n",
       "191601  The Oblagi sun shield with tint is rated at spf 50 providing excellent coverage for your sunbathing needs.  The addition of tint covers and blends evenly with most skin tones and does a good job that you may consider going makeup free for the day.  The product is very thin which is a good thing as it provides plenty of coverage without having to use to much.  The non greasy feel allows you to enjoy your day in the sun without feeling oily and uncomfortable.  The product itself is wonderful, but easily the most expensive that I have ever used.  For a large family this may not last more then several days especially after reapplying throughout the day.  To make the product last, you may consider only using this only for your face while using something less expensive for the rest of your body (or your family )  If cost is no object then this is certainly over if the most effective and useful sunscreens in the market.

The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds. But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up. There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!  If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter), then the monitor is pretty crystal clear. The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!). So, if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night, or every other night, then I guess this monitor would be okay. But if you have that kind of money, I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one. I think I am going to return this for something a little better.  I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually have such great quality products. I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.

The base was set up in a downstairs bedroom and the receiver stayed upstairs. We set it on voice activation and the unit worked like a charm.

       "4781    This monitor is decent for the price, I guess. But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better. The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds. But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up. There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!  If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter), then the monitor is pretty crystal clear. The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!). So, if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night, or every other night, then I guess this monitor would be okay. But if you have that kind of money, I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one. I think I am going to return this for something a little better.  I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually have such great quality products. I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.  My suggestion: don't [spend] your money on this monitor.   \n",

He would lean forward because he was still needing support to sit upright, so I started rolling up a towel or blanket and putting it between his chest and the walker. Let me tell you, he just loved it from the moment we put him in! He would just laugh and laugh and push off with his feet like crazy.I think we ejoy watching him in it more than him. I love the brake pads feature which prevent the walker from going over any changes in flooring, like stairs or a door jam. I actually took them off, as our house is only one story, and I am always near to him while he is in it.THe little piano tray is excellent, and has such a variety of sounds and songs that he can make. THey are not too annoying or shrill sounding, either, like so many childrens toys.It was not too hard to put together, although i did need to follow the manual pretty closely, as I could not figure out the pieces on my own. I think it probably took about 20 minutes to get all set up.I like that the music tray is removeable, so it can become a tray for little toys or even snacks later on.I wold highly recommend this toy, as my son seems to like it very much</td>\n",

       "138288  I started letting my son play in this walker when he was about 4 months old. He would lean forward because he was still needing support to sit upright, so I started rolling up a towel or blanket and putting it between his chest and the walker. Let me tell you, he just loved it from the moment we put him in! He would just laugh and laugh and push off with his feet like crazy.I think we ejoy watching him in it more than him. I love the brake pads feature which prevent the walker from going over any changes in flooring, like stairs or a door jam. I actually took them off, as our house is only one story, and I am always near to him while he is in it.THe little piano tray is excellent, and has such a variety of sounds and songs that he can make. THey are not too annoying or shrill sounding, either, like so many childrens toys.It was not too hard to put together, although i did need to follow the manual pretty closely, as I could not figure out the pieces on my own. I think it probably took about 20 minutes to get all set up.I like that the music tray is removeable, so it can become a tray for little toys or even snacks later on.I wold highly recommend this toy, as my son seems to like it very much   \n",

       "131116  Our daughter loves this. Yes, it's a little pricey, but it's worth it because we are so much less likely to lose this one versus others (which somehow find themselves rolling into the driveway, under the restaurant table, etc.). Stands up well when you wash the whole thing, which was a big selling point for me. I like this one because a couple kids at her daycare have them but nobody had the pink bear but my girl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

We ordered chocolate brown, and it has a very nice &#34;sheen&#34; to it as well--almost like a sateen sheet.  The only downside is that it does not fit around the mattress of our pack-n-play.  I measured before purchasing, and it seemed as though it should fit, however, there is a great deal of extra fabric.  It almost seems as if it would fit a much more thick mattress (maybe even up to 2-3 inches or so.)   \n",

       "      <td>I bought this product shortly after my baby girl was born, so she could use it when she was able to sit up on her own.  In theory, it seemed like a good idea ... On trips to the grocery store, my little-one could sit in the shopping cart and look around without me worrying about her getting her hands and mouth on the germy, gross shopping cart handles, etc.  In reality, however, this Eddie Bauer shopping cart cover turned out to be a huge disappointment.  First off, the product was packaged with the WRONG INSTRUCTIONS.  According to the enclosed user guide, in addition to the safety harness, this shopping cart cover is also supposed to have another strap that threads out of the back of the cover (just below the backrest), wraps around the shopping cart bars, and then wraps around your baby's waist to anchor the cover and your baby securely to the cart.  Well, the product I purchased didn't have this additional strap, or any holes in it for threading the strap through.  After half an hour of trying in vain to find this mysterious strap and thinking I was losing my mind, I called the manufacturer of the cover, Goldbug, Inc.  The customer service rep told me that the wrong instructions had been mistakenly shipped with some of these products, and that there was, in fact, no additional safety strap to secure the cover to the shopping cart.  The representative emailed me a copy of the correct instructions for the product, which state that the only way to attach the cover to the shopping cart is to use the fabric ties.The omission of a safety strap is a major design flaw in this product, since the fabric ties do a very poor job of keeping the cover or baby securely anchored to the shopping cart.  The cover slides around and feels very insecure.  Plus, an older baby can quickly figure out how to untie the ties, making the cover even less safe.  (Especially if you tie them in bows, as shown in the manufacturer's own picture of the product in use).  In addition, as any parent of a babe-in-arms or an active toddler can tell you, a shopping cart cover should ideally be quickly and easily installable with one hand, as the other hand is often holding (or holding onto) your child.  It's very inconvenient to have to be fiddling with the fabric ties while holding onto a squirming child.  I would have returned this product to the store I bought it from, but by the time I actually got around to trying to use this cover, I'd lost the receipt.  So it's now sitting in storage, where it'll most likely stay until I throw it out.  (I decided against donating it because I think it's a less-than-safe product).Grade: D-</td>\n",

You have to wash it several times, braid it... just really mess it up to &#34;break it in&#34; or its practically useless.It's still not completely broken in for us but we have wrapped 2x with it now and the first time was a complete FLOP.The second time we did a reinforced ruck tied tibetan, it worked better but the wrap itself is still hard to work w/ it because of the gauze material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "93387   Good value, but doesn't always stay on the pillow, especially if my toddler has an active night of tossing and turning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "61959   I bought this product shortly after my baby girl was born, so she could use it when she was able to sit up on her own.  In theory, it seemed like a good idea ... On trips to the grocery store, my little-one could sit in the shopping cart and look around without me worrying about her getting her hands and mouth on the germy, gross shopping cart handles, etc.  In reality, however, this Eddie Bauer shopping cart cover turned out to be a huge disappointment.  First off, the product was packaged with the WRONG INSTRUCTIONS.  According to the enclosed user guide, in addition to the safety harness, this shopping cart cover is also supposed to have another strap that threads out of the back of the cover (just below the backrest), wraps around the shopping cart bars, and then wraps around your baby's waist to anchor the cover and your baby securely to the cart.  Well, the product I purchased didn't have this additional strap, or any holes in it for threading the strap through.  After half an hour of trying in vain to find this mysterious strap and thinking I was losing my mind, I called the manufacturer of the cover, Goldbug, Inc.  The customer service rep told me that the wrong instructions had been mistakenly shipped with some of these products, and that there was, in fact, no additional safety strap to secure the cover to the shopping cart.  The representative emailed me a copy of the correct instructions for the product, which state that the only way to attach the cover to the shopping cart is to use the fabric ties.The omission of a safety strap is a major design flaw in this product, since the fabric ties do a very poor job of keeping the cover or baby securely anchored to the shopping cart.  The cover slides around and feels very insecure.  Plus, an older baby can quickly figure out how to untie the ties, making the cover even less safe.  (Especially if you tie them in bows, as shown in the manufacturer's own picture of the product in use).  In addition, as any parent of a babe-in-arms or an active toddler can tell you, a shopping cart cover should ideally be quickly and easily installable with one hand, as the other hand is often holding (or holding onto) your child.  It's very inconvenient to have to be fiddling with the fabric ties while holding onto a squirming child.  I would have returned this product to the store I bought it from, but by the time I actually got around to trying to use this cover, I'd lost the receipt.  So it's now sitting in storage, where it'll most likely stay until I throw it out.  (I decided against donating it because I think it's a less-than-safe product).Grade: D-   \n",

I read in other reviews before purchasing that the stackable screw-on containers were a difficult to screw on and off, I found that to be the case in the beginning but found out that you need to align the layer right on top of the bottom before screwing on.On days when I am not too sure how long I will be out I use all four containers, on days when I'm out only for a couple of hours I fill up only 1 layer and take it with me- having it in my diaper bag just incase really gives me a peace of mind as well. The funnel top makes it very easy to pour into bottles without any mess, I have found that when the bottle is filled to the top with water it can be very hard to pour all that formula powder into it but this would be the case whether you are using this dispenser or not, the trick is to simply use a big bottle opposed to the small bottle.Thus far the dispenser has served me well and I have no real complaints about it. I love it! And it would make a great snack container too when baby get old enough to actually eat them.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.</td>\n",

We tried the slow and medium-flow nipples with the same results. The only solution would be to open/loosen the cap up a little bit and that defeated the whole purpose of these \"air-bubble-free\" bottles.On the plus side they do clean-up easy and fit our bottle warmer nicely.BTW, we have had the best results with the Medela Breastmilk Bottles and \"S\" flow nipples.

       "126212  I didn't really begin to use the Piyo Piyo 4-layer milk powder dispenser until my baby became exclusively formula fed. It is one of the greatest inventions for moms! I read in other reviews before purchasing that the stackable screw-on containers were a difficult to screw on and off, I found that to be the case in the beginning but found out that you need to align the layer right on top of the bottom before screwing on.On days when I am not too sure how long I will be out I use all four containers, on days when I'm out only for a couple of hours I fill up only 1 layer and take it with me- having it in my diaper bag just incase really gives me a peace of mind as well. The funnel top makes it very easy to pour into bottles without any mess, I have found that when the bottle is filled to the top with water it can be very hard to pour all that formula powder into it but this would be the case whether you are using this dispenser or not, the trick is to simply use a big bottle opposed to the small bottle.Thus far the dispenser has served me well and I have no real complaints about it. I love it! And it would make a great snack container too when baby get old enough to actually eat them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "15720   The Philips AVENT Bottle Brush  has a thick cluster of bristles at the end which really help with scrubbing out the bottom of the bottles. I soak my bottles in a large bowl using a combo of vinegar, baking soda, and water after which I use the brush to clean out the bottles, and the result is squeaky clean bottles and parts. The back of the brush has a short groove running down the center which my finger rests on when I'm using it to clean, it's a small detail but I notice that it makes it more comfortable to use. I'm really happy with this purchase!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "70779   We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.   \n",
       "113379  These are a awesome way to take extra formula along in , whether u put these in or out of bottle. I also use them for cereal sometimes on the go..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "160443  We tried these for a week and just couldn't get our 5-month old to accept them. He would suck so hard on these that the nipple would collapse and then he'd start to complain. We tried the slow and medium-flow nipples with the same results. The only solution would be to open/loosen the cap up a little bit and that defeated the whole purpose of these \"air-bubble-free\" bottles.On the plus side they do clean-up easy and fit our bottle warmer nicely.BTW, we have had the best results with the Medela Breastmilk Bottles and \"S\" flow nipples. Simple design, good value, and no issues to date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I thought the leaks were normal. Now that we are in regular sized diapers I know that the leaks were not normal. The seams around the legs seem like they are unfinished so that the inner fabric touches whatever baby is wearing or sitting on. So even if the diaper doesn't drip pee it will always seep it. Some days (and often) baby went through a new change of clothes with every diaper change. The first time I just used one outfit all day long I thought it was a miracle. But no, thats how the diapers should work! I stripped the diapers and everything, but they always leaked. I currently use bigger size GroVia diapers along with several other brands and don't have a leak problem. It is obviously specific to the make and fit of the NEWBORN diapers. Horrible.We only bought GroVia brand for the newborn sized diapers. We currently use several brands of one-size diapers. I HIGHLY recommend buying several brands of both newborn and one-size diapers. The one-size can be too huge on a newborn. Its nice to have something that fits better for the first month or two. But GroVia newborn diapers leaked like crazy for us. I'll try them again with baby two, but am definitely buying another brand's newborn diapers next time!</td>\n",

       "87727   Love this for swimsuits, dirty diapers, and as a bag within the diaper bag to fill with just a few diapers, wipes and diaper cream.  On a recent 5 hour airplane flight, we just kept this bag under the seat in front of us with changing necessities and a change of clothes for baby.  We were able to put the larger diaper bag in the overhead compartment and had a lot more leg room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "123143  We have a couple and we hang them from the corner of our changing table so they are very handy for diaper changes.  Hasn't leaked or anything yet.  The yellow is very bright!

       "129899  LEAK like crazy! I loved them when we were using them because I was so excited to use cloth diapers and so excited about my baby that I didn't mind baby pee on me. I thought the leaks were normal. Now that we are in regular sized diapers I know that the leaks were not normal. The seams around the legs seem like they are unfinished so that the inner fabric touches whatever baby is wearing or sitting on. So even if the diaper doesn't drip pee it will always seep it. Some days (and often) baby went through a new change of clothes with every diaper change. The first time I just used one outfit all day long I thought it was a miracle. But no, thats how the diapers should work! I stripped the diapers and everything, but they always leaked. I currently use bigger size GroVia diapers along with several other brands and don't have a leak problem. It is obviously specific to the make and fit of the NEWBORN diapers. Horrible.We only bought GroVia brand for the newborn sized diapers. We currently use several brands of one-size diapers. I HIGHLY recommend buying several brands of both newborn and one-size diapers. The one-size can be too huge on a newborn. Its nice to have something that fits better for the first month or two. But GroVia newborn diapers leaked like crazy for us. I'll try them again with baby two, but am definitely buying another brand's newborn diapers next time!   \n",

I think they were the first to come out with a diaper disposal system, since the name \"Diaper Genie\" is to diapers as Xerox is to copiers.Unfortunately, the Diaper Genie is a terribly designed product (this from an engineer).  It finally broke on us for good a couple of weeks ago.Enter the Diaper Dekor...This thing is really honestly and truly hands-free.  I'm serious.  You drop the diaper in and you're finished.As emptying it, it's as simple as trying to knots.  Trust me, it takes 30 seconds maximum to empty it.  We haven't had to load a new refill, since these refills last as long as 5 of the Diaper Genie refills.As for the great odor debate, we found it to be slightly less odiforous than the Diaper Genie.  Let's face it - leave dirty diapers in a warm room for a week or more, and it WILL smell.There IS one poor aspect to the Diaper Dekor - you'll read about it in every review...  The door that you open to empty it is NOT child resistant.  In reality, it is a child-magnet.I found a clean solution to the problem, but it is a shame we have to do this.  Go to Home Depot, and buy a roll of the BLUE painter's masking tape.  It is in the paint section, and looke like a roll of masking tape, but it's blue.  Buy the 1 1/2\" width.Put a strip over the recessed knob, and the kids won't be able to open the DIaper Dekor.  The reason you want the blue stuff is that it can be pulled off and WON'T leave any sticky.You could also simply put the Diaper Dekor on a shelf, and use your hand to open the top lid before dropping in a diaper.Either way, this gets 4 stars compared to the 0 star Diaper Genie.</td>\n",

       "4914    We got the Diaper Genie as a shower gift.  I think they were the first to come out with a diaper disposal system, since the name \"Diaper Genie\" is to diapers as Xerox is to copiers.Unfortunately, the Diaper Genie is a terribly designed product (this from an engineer).  It finally broke on us for good a couple of weeks ago.Enter the Diaper Dekor...This thing is really honestly and truly hands-free.  I'm serious.  You drop the diaper in and you're finished.As emptying it, it's as simple as trying to knots.  Trust me, it takes 30 seconds maximum to empty it.  We haven't had to load a new refill, since these refills last as long as 5 of the Diaper Genie refills.As for the great odor debate, we found it to be slightly less odiforous than the Diaper Genie.  Let's face it - leave dirty diapers in a warm room for a week or more, and it WILL smell.There IS one poor aspect to the Diaper Dekor - you'll read about it in every review...  The door that you open to empty it is NOT child resistant.  In reality, it is a child-magnet.I found a clean solution to the problem, but it is a shame we have to do this.  Go to Home Depot, and buy a roll of the BLUE painter's masking tape.  It is in the paint section, and looke like a roll of masking tape, but it's blue.  Buy the 1 1/2\" width.Put a strip over the recessed knob, and the kids won't be able to open the DIaper Dekor.  The reason you want the blue stuff is that it can be pulled off and WON'T leave any sticky.You could also simply put the Diaper Dekor on a shelf, and use your hand to open the top lid before dropping in a diaper.Either way, this gets 4 stars compared to the 0 star Diaper Genie.   \n",
       "4924    We are very pleased with this diaper pail. It does a good job of containing the odors and accommodates a large number of diapers. However, the thing we were most impressed with is the simple yet efficient disposal system. It's really neat and well thought through. Also, we like the re-usability aspect as a trash can for later. Highly recommended product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "      <td>I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&amp;eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&amp;eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(WARNING- THIS IS AN IN DEPTH REVIEW.  IF YOU WANT A QUICK SUMMARY, SEE THE BOTTOM LINE  SECTION AT THE END)\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to test out a wide variety of skin care products from all types of companies.  I have used products from companies such as Lancome, Algenist, Christian Dior, La Prairie, Fresh, Chanel, L'Occitaine, Vichy, Tarte, L'Oreal, Olay, Aubrey Organics, Peter Lamas, and quite a few others. I have used products which are not natural in base and others which are all natural in base.  Every product promises to deliver smooth skin, firm youthful changes, wrinkles smoothed, and a variety of other anti-aging or healthy skin promises.\\n\\nSome of these products are stunning and work very quickly.  Other products take more time to begin to show- sometimes several purchases of product to get there.  Still other products never really do seem to deliver what they promise.\\n\\nWhen it comes to skin care, let's be honest here.  Not everyone reacts the same way to products.  That means that what works for me might not work for you.  However, as a makeup artist, I work with a variety of skin types, so I test and use products with not just my own skin in mind.\\n\\nWHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?\\nSkin &amp; Co Truffle Therapy cream comes in an amber jar with a gold lid.  The lid has a single liner in it (shiny cardboard) but does not have an inner lid that can be replaced like so many other brands do.  This only has a foam liner which peels off for the first use and you don't put it back.  It gets too messy.  The cream itself is medium in texture.  It is not thick and it is not runny.  It is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe cream has a definite coconut fragrance that is reminiscent of beach suntan lotions.  It also has a smokey tinge to it which is most likely from the truffles in it.  There are also \"cones\" (like dimethicone) which help to make the skin feel smoother.  Also there is no SPF in this cream which I am very happy about.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I will wear what I want.  If I don't want sunscreen, I don't want to be forced to wear it.\\n\\nONE SMALL PROBLEM\\nWhen I received this cream, I found it had leaked all over the jar and box.  Not too much was lost, but for the price, it was a bit frustrating to find it arriving like that.  It could be because it is summer and when it was shipped, perhaps it was in a hot location which caused this- as is very possible with many products when it is very hot out.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CREAM\\nI recently wrote a review on another Skin &amp; Co product that I tested&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;SKIN&amp;CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;.  At the time I did not have the cream nor did I know I would be testing it out.  So, when I tested this cream, I did it in a few ways.\\n\\nCREAM ALONE\\nI tested this cream alone without any serum of any kind under it.  My results were that the skin was smoothed and moisturized.  The level of moisture and smoothness, however, was not extraordinary.  The smoothness lasted most of the day and the moisture began to fade about mid afternoon.  I would say that this is medium to lightweight in nature when used alone.  I saw a gentle performance on the face, but nothing remarkable.\\n\\nCREAM AND SERUM\\nWhen I decided to compare the cream performance, I used it with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;SKIN&amp;CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the other side of my face and the difference was worth mentioning.  My skin felt MUCH smoother, MUCH more moisturized and the results lasted until the following morning.  I did see a bit more difference in the side where I used the cream with the serum.  My skin looked a little more glowy and a little more fresh and moisturized than the side with only the cream.  I also saw a light lift to the face as well.\\n\\nBoth uses leave the skin not greasy and it absorbs quickly, used with serum or not.  That is what makes it especially nice for summer.\\n\\nWHO IS THIS CREAM SUITED FOR?\\nI would say after my experience that this cream is great for summer use for even mature skin.  I am not sure about winter, as I am thinking that it might not be moisturizing enough for dry or mature skin.  There is no SPF in it WHICH I LOVE, so you can use whatever you want if you want sunscreen.  I would say that this cream is great for normal to oily skin (unless it is VERY oily) even in winter time.\\n\\nIf you have great needs for skin pick me up as far as wrinkles, brightness, sagging, and age spots, I don't think that this cream will be your miracle cream.  It is a good basic cream and when used with the serum, it is even nicer.  There is a light lift when used with the serum.  But it does not seem to reach the level of Lancome Absolue, Algenist Genius, Dior Capture or One or some of the other high end products which provide really quick differences within literally days.\\n\\nThis is more in line with the L'Occitaine, L'Oreal, Dior Hydra, Fresh, Aubrey Organics, and some of the other lines from the drugstore that I have tried that work nicely but not miraculously.\\n\\nThis Truffle Cream is definitely better than some skincare I have tried which did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\\nWhen used alone, this cream is a nice moisturizer for lightweight to medium moisture.  Not much change in the face (tested on a few faces with light lines and aging) but a little bit of a glow added and healthier look to the skin.  It is good to use under makeup as it provides a smooth finish, but it might not be enough for mature skin or very dry skin especially in winter.  It does absorb quite quickly leaving the skin ready and fresh for makeup in a good amount of time.\\n\\nUsed with the serum designed to go with it, the cream steps up a notch and I did see some mild changes to the skin which lasted a lot longer.  There is a glow with some line improvement on light lines leaving a nice glow to the skin. I also saw a light lift to the face after only a few days.  Again, however, with some people with aging signs and a need of a lot of lift and youthful appearance, this might not fit the bill for you.\\n\\nGreat for summer for most skin types and probably more for normal to lightly oily skin for winter, this cream (and serum too) are good for solid moisturizing, light anti aging benefits at a pretty good price compared to some lines of skin care.  It does have some natural ingredients in it.\\n\\nIf you find the scent of coconut at the beach not a positive thing, you might not like this.  It definitely has a coconut fragrance to it which has a deeper smokey tinge to it, and it does not fade fast.  This could be a problem for some, but for me, I have gotten used to it.  I actually like it for summer use.\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this four stars because I didn't see remarkable changes with it, but it is a good solid performer for moisturizing, light anti-aging  and lift benefits and skin care in the summer without sunscreen.  I wanted to really give it four and a half stars because even though it is not five stars, I still am thankful to have found a cream with no sunscreen in it that is good for summer and does a solid job of what it does do as listed above.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Oblagi sun shield with tint is rated at spf 50 providing excellent coverage for your sunbathing needs.  The addition of tint covers and blends evenly with most skin tones and does a good job that you may consider going makeup free for the day.  The product is very thin which is a good thing as it provides plenty of coverage without having to use to much.  The non greasy feel allows you to enjoy your day in the sun without feeling oily and uncomfortable.  The product itself is wonderful, but easily the most expensive that I have ever used.  For a large family this may not last more then several days especially after reapplying throughout the day.  To make the product last, you may consider only using this only for your face while using something less expensive for the rest of your body (or your family )  If cost is no object then this is certainly over if the most effective and useful sunscreens in the market.</td>\n",

       "184872  I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.

       "168717  I have used this Jane Iredale product now for 6 years.  Once introduced to it I fell in love with the appearance it gives your skin.  Does not flake or look drying on the skin.  Use with the stamping brush (bought separately) and stipple it onto your face with this brush.  It leaves no residue and makes your skin look like porcelain.  Just make sure you get the right color shade for your skin.  I am fair skin and this works great.

       "187359  Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation was thicker than I usually wear so that surprised me, but it went on smoothly and covered well.  The tint was perfect for me and the makeup looked so good.  It wasn't messy or difficult to put on.  It wore well throughout the day and since it's summer, oil from my skin didn't break through and look greasy.  I didn't need any more powder than the amount I put on in the morning after I apply foundation.  Great makeup l definitely buy again.

       "184946  (WARNING- THIS IS AN IN DEPTH REVIEW.  IF YOU WANT A QUICK SUMMARY, SEE THE BOTTOM LINE  SECTION AT THE END)\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to test out a wide variety of skin care products from all types of companies.  I have used products from companies such as Lancome, Algenist, Christian Dior, La Prairie, Fresh, Chanel, L'Occitaine, Vichy, Tarte, L'Oreal, Olay, Aubrey Organics, Peter Lamas, and quite a few others. I have used products which are not natural in base and others which are all natural in base.  Every product promises to deliver smooth skin, firm youthful changes, wrinkles smoothed, and a variety of other anti-aging or healthy skin promises.\\n\\nSome of these products are stunning and work very quickly.  Other products take more time to begin to show- sometimes several purchases of product to get there.  Still other products never really do seem to deliver what they promise.\\n\\nWhen it comes to skin care, let's be honest here.  Not everyone reacts the same way to products.  That means that what works for me might not work for you.  However, as a makeup artist, I work with a variety of skin types, so I test and use products with not just my own skin in mind.\\n\\nWHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?\\nSkin & Co Truffle Therapy cream comes in an amber jar with a gold lid.  The lid has a single liner in it (shiny cardboard) but does not have an inner lid that can be replaced like so many other brands do.  This only has a foam liner which peels off for the first use and you don't put it back.  It gets too messy.  The cream itself is medium in texture.  It is not thick and it is not runny.  It is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe cream has a definite coconut fragrance that is reminiscent of beach suntan lotions.  It also has a smokey tinge to it which is most likely from the truffles in it.  There are also \"cones\" (like dimethicone) which help to make the skin feel smoother.  Also there is no SPF in this cream which I am very happy about.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I will wear what I want.  If I don't want sunscreen, I don't want to be forced to wear it.\\n\\nONE SMALL PROBLEM\\nWhen I received this cream, I found it had leaked all over the jar and box.  Not too much was lost, but for the price, it was a bit frustrating to find it arriving like that.  It could be because it is summer and when it was shipped, perhaps it was in a hot location which caused this- as is very possible with many products when it is very hot out.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CREAM\\nI recently wrote a review on another Skin & Co product that I tested&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>.  At the time I did not have the cream nor did I know I would be testing it out.  So, when I tested this cream, I did it in a few ways.\\n\\nCREAM ALONE\\nI tested this cream alone without any serum of any kind under it.  My results were that the skin was smoothed and moisturized.  The level of moisture and smoothness, however, was not extraordinary.  The smoothness lasted most of the day and the moisture began to fade about mid afternoon.  I would say that this is medium to lightweight in nature when used alone.  I saw a gentle performance on the face, but nothing remarkable.\\n\\nCREAM AND SERUM\\nWhen I decided to compare the cream performance, I used it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;on the other side of my face and the difference was worth mentioning.  My skin felt MUCH smoother, MUCH more moisturized and the results lasted until the following morning.  I did see a bit more difference in the side where I used the cream with the serum.  My skin looked a little more glowy and a little more fresh and moisturized than the side with only the cream.  I also saw a light lift to the face as well.\\n\\nBoth uses leave the skin not greasy and it absorbs quickly, used with serum or not.  That is what makes it especially nice for summer.\\n\\nWHO IS THIS CREAM SUITED FOR?\\nI would say after my experience that this cream is great for summer use for even mature skin.  I am not sure about winter, as I am thinking that it might not be moisturizing enough for dry or mature skin.  There is no SPF in it WHICH I LOVE, so you can use whatever you want if you want sunscreen.  I would say that this cream is great for normal to oily skin (unless it is VERY oily) even in winter time.\\n\\nIf you have great needs for skin pick me up as far as wrinkles, brightness, sagging, and age spots, I don't think that this cream will be your miracle cream.  It is a good basic cream and when used with the serum, it is even nicer.  There is a light lift when used with the serum.  But it does not seem to reach the level of Lancome Absolue, Algenist Genius, Dior Capture or One or some of the other high end products which provide really quick differences within literally days.\\n\\nThis is more in line with the L'Occitaine, L'Oreal, Dior Hydra, Fresh, Aubrey Organics, and some of the other lines from the drugstore that I have tried that work nicely but not miraculously.\\n\\nThis Truffle Cream is definitely better than some skincare I have tried which did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\\nWhen used alone, this cream is a nice moisturizer for lightweight to medium moisture.  Not much change in the face (tested on a few faces with light lines and aging) but a little bit of a glow added and healthier look to the skin.  It is good to use under makeup as it provides a smooth finish, but it might not be enough for mature skin or very dry skin especially in winter.  It does absorb quite quickly leaving the skin ready and fresh for makeup in a good amount of time.\\n\\nUsed with the serum designed to go with it, the cream steps up a notch and I did see some mild changes to the skin which lasted a lot longer.  There is a glow with some line improvement on light lines leaving a nice glow to the skin. I also saw a light lift to the face after only a few days.  Again, however, with some people with aging signs and a need of a lot of lift and youthful appearance, this might not fit the bill for you.\\n\\nGreat for summer for most skin types and probably more for normal to lightly oily skin for winter, this cream (and serum too) are good for solid moisturizing, light anti aging benefits at a pretty good price compared to some lines of skin care.  It does have some natural ingredients in it.\\n\\nIf you find the scent of coconut at the beach not a positive thing, you might not like this.  It definitely has a coconut fragrance to it which has a deeper smokey tinge to it, and it does not fade fast.  This could be a problem for some, but for me, I have gotten used to it.  I actually like it for summer use.\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this four stars because I didn't see remarkable changes with it, but it is a good solid performer for moisturizing, light anti-aging  and lift benefits and skin care in the summer without sunscreen.  I wanted to really give it four and a half stars because even though it is not five stars, I still am thankful to have found a cream with no sunscreen in it that is good for summer and does a solid job of what it does do as listed above.   \n",
       "191601  The Oblagi sun shield with tint is rated at spf 50 providing excellent coverage for your sunbathing needs.  The addition of tint covers and blends evenly with most skin tones and does a good job that you may consider going makeup free for the day.  The product is very thin which is a good thing as it provides plenty of coverage without having to use to much.  The non greasy feel allows you to enjoy your day in the sun without feeling oily and uncomfortable.  The product itself is wonderful, but easily the most expensive that I have ever used.  For a large family this may not last more then several days especially after reapplying throughout the day.  To make the product last, you may consider only using this only for your face while using something less expensive for the rest of your body (or your family )  If cost is no object then this is certainly over if the most effective and useful sunscreens in the market.

When it arrived it was way to small.  I could not close the front.  I also reviewed how it is set up and it basically holds the pumps to your breast, so you don't want it too tight.  It could easily form a clogged duct with the amount of pressure if it was too tight.  So, I emailed the company and requested a return, I explained that I felt the sizing chart was off.

       "202439  Well, I don't really know what else to say.. I ordered them for the guitar, Though I won't be using them for the banjo. (I prefer the sound of clawhammer banjo)The thumb picks fit my thumb perfectly, and the finger picks only needed a tiny squeeze to stay put. They feel kind of alien right now, as it's the first time I've ever wore finger picks, but I'll get used to them eventually :P.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "197360  The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "78856   I ordered this off of amazon due to the reviews it has received.  I read the sizing chart and ordered according to the companies recommendations.  When it arrived it was way to small.  I could not close the front.  I also reviewed how it is set up and it basically holds the pumps to your breast, so you don't want it too tight.  It could easily form a clogged duct with the amount of pressure if it was too tight.  So, I emailed the company and requested a return, I explained that I felt the sizing chart was off.  The company accepted my suggustion, said they would take a look at the sizing chart and they accepted my return.  I am giving 4 stars not for the product, I would give 3 stars especially for the price.  I'm sure this did not nearly cost this much to make, even if it is imported.  We design and import organic bibs and the mark up is a little greedy if you ask me, but I believe there is a certain percentage that Amazon needs to take.  However, I am giving it 4 stars for customer service.  Thanks for accepting my return.   \n",

While you can't beat an electric double pump for efficiency, sometimes it's really nice to have a hand pump.  I chose this one simply because the valves, bottles, and breast shields are interchangeable with the ones for my electric pump, and it works just fine.  The pumping mechanism itself seems well designed so it's pretty comfortable to pump, even for my relatively small hands.  It's really easy to clean since the pumping part itself never comes in contact with milk.Having a great sleeper, I've struggled with engorgement, especially at night, and this hand pump has quickly become essential.  It's so much quieter and easier to set up than my electric pump that it's perfect for quick night-time relief.  The suction seems gentler than the electric pump so is more comfortable, but takes longer to fully drain the breast.  Since I'm not looking for full drainage or stimulation at night, this pump is perfect.  I've also used it while a passenger in a car and in various public restrooms when it's bulky electric big sister would be inconvenient.  Everything comes apart and is small enough to fit in a zip-lock sandwich bag (except the bottle).</td>\n",

If you have really raw nipples they offer a much needed relief and the ability to get air.  I use them at night so that they catch anything that I leak, and I can then just pour the milk into the baby's mouth via a little spout on the edge.

       "86781  I bought a barely used pump off of a coworkers wife and I replaced everything but the motor.  The medela accessories kit does not come with replacement tubing so this was perfect and so was the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "13474  I waited four months before purchasing a hand pump, and wish I had done so sooner.  My insurance covered the full cost of the Medela Pump In Style, which I use daily while at work.  While you can't beat an electric double pump for efficiency, sometimes it's really nice to have a hand pump.  I chose this one simply because the valves, bottles, and breast shields are interchangeable with the ones for my electric pump, and it works just fine.  The pumping mechanism itself seems well designed so it's pretty comfortable to pump, even for my relatively small hands.  It's really easy to clean since the pumping part itself never comes in contact with milk.Having a great sleeper, I've struggled with engorgement, especially at night, and this hand pump has quickly become essential.  It's so much quieter and easier to set up than my electric pump that it's perfect for quick night-time relief.  The suction seems gentler than the electric pump so is more comfortable, but takes longer to fully drain the breast.  Since I'm not looking for full drainage or stimulation at night, this pump is perfect.  I've also used it while a passenger in a car and in various public restrooms when it's bulky electric big sister would be inconvenient.  Everything comes apart and is small enough to fit in a zip-lock sandwich bag (except the bottle).   \n",
       "3354   You absolutely cannot wear these out in public!  This is for home use only!  They do not match the contour of the breast at all so there's a totally weird bulge on your boob when you wear them.  So with that being said, if you do just wear these at home, they can be great!  If you have really raw nipples they offer a much needed relief and the ability to get air.  I use them at night so that they catch anything that I leak, and I can then just pour the milk into the baby's mouth via a little spout on the edge.  I find that I go the longest without nursing through the night, so this offers a great way to never waste a drop!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

He would lean forward because he was still needing support to sit upright, so I started rolling up a towel or blanket and putting it between his chest and the walker. Let me tell you, he just loved it from the moment we put him in! He would just laugh and laugh and push off with his feet like crazy.I think we ejoy watching him in it more than him. I love the brake pads feature which prevent the walker from going over any changes in flooring, like stairs or a door jam. I actually took them off, as our house is only one story, and I am always near to him while he is in it.THe little piano tray is excellent, and has such a variety of sounds and songs that he can make. THey are not too annoying or shrill sounding, either, like so many childrens toys.It was not too hard to put together, although i did need to follow the manual pretty closely, as I could not figure out the pieces on my own. I think it probably took about 20 minutes to get all set up.I like that the music tray is removeable, so it can become a tray for little toys or even snacks later on.I wold highly recommend this toy, as my son seems to like it very much</td>\n",

       "138288  I started letting my son play in this walker when he was about 4 months old. He would lean forward because he was still needing support to sit upright, so I started rolling up a towel or blanket and putting it between his chest and the walker. Let me tell you, he just loved it from the moment we put him in! He would just laugh and laugh and push off with his feet like crazy.I think we ejoy watching him in it more than him. I love the brake pads feature which prevent the walker from going over any changes in flooring, like stairs or a door jam. I actually took them off, as our house is only one story, and I am always near to him while he is in it.THe little piano tray is excellent, and has such a variety of sounds and songs that he can make. THey are not too annoying or shrill sounding, either, like so many childrens toys.It was not too hard to put together, although i did need to follow the manual pretty closely, as I could not figure out the pieces on my own. I think it probably took about 20 minutes to get all set up.I like that the music tray is removeable, so it can become a tray for little toys or even snacks later on.I wold highly recommend this toy, as my son seems to like it very much   \n",
       "47180   This product is really large (takes up my 4 month olds whole bottom half of her face), really bulky, and really heavy (which makes it tough for her to hold onto or keep in her mouth).

       "12435   My 4 month old son loves all of his soft, crinkle books and mommy likes that this one can attach different places so that it does not fall to the ground. Adorable Pooh images and peek-a-boo windows.

       "81307   I tried several different teethers for my daughter before finding these. She LOVES them! It's great that they have no water as I've heard stories about all the bacteria that can grow in those water or gel filled teether. However, the plastic still has enough give to be chewy and great to gnaw on. They are BPA free and NOT made in China.

I like this one because a couple kids at her daycare have them but nobody had the pink bear but my girl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "103583  My daughter wanted constant holding. Very few times could I set her to play alone the fist 3 months, but I splurged on this one at 2.5 months because the Skip Hop owl puppet was the first toy she showed amusement with, and I was hoping to find some relief. Being able to set her down happy for 10-15 minutes at a time was worth the price. She is almost 6 months old now and still likes it. Plus, Skip Hop's designs are adorable and not too obnoxiously bright.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "58074   I love this wooden toy for our Bjorn bouncer.  Our 3 month old has just hit the stage where he notices it and loves babbling to the \"cookie\" in the middle with googly eyes. He grabs the beads with his hands and lifts feet to touch it too. Fun for him and I can actually get some chores done now! ;)Update: We're now at 6 months and our little one still LOVES this thing. BUY IT. It's adorable and yes, it's worth the $. I cringed when I bought the organic chair but my gosh, it has paid for itself so many times over.  Absolutely a must for everyone caring for a baby. The bouncer & this toy are worth every cent. (And they have excellent resale value if that interests you.)   \n",

       "      <td>I bought this product shortly after my baby girl was born, so she could use it when she was able to sit up on her own.  In theory, it seemed like a good idea ... On trips to the grocery store, my little-one could sit in the shopping cart and look around without me worrying about her getting her hands and mouth on the germy, gross shopping cart handles, etc.  In reality, however, this Eddie Bauer shopping cart cover turned out to be a huge disappointment.  First off, the product was packaged with the WRONG INSTRUCTIONS.  According to the enclosed user guide, in addition to the safety harness, this shopping cart cover is also supposed to have another strap that threads out of the back of the cover (just below the backrest), wraps around the shopping cart bars, and then wraps around your baby's waist to anchor the cover and your baby securely to the cart.  Well, the product I purchased didn't have this additional strap, or any holes in it for threading the strap through.  After half an hour of trying in vain to find this mysterious strap and thinking I was losing my mind, I called the manufacturer of the cover, Goldbug, Inc.  The customer service rep told me that the wrong instructions had been mistakenly shipped with some of these products, and that there was, in fact, no additional safety strap to secure the cover to the shopping cart.  The representative emailed me a copy of the correct instructions for the product, which state that the only way to attach the cover to the shopping cart is to use the fabric ties.The omission of a safety strap is a major design flaw in this product, since the fabric ties do a very poor job of keeping the cover or baby securely anchored to the shopping cart.  The cover slides around and feels very insecure.  Plus, an older baby can quickly figure out how to untie the ties, making the cover even less safe.  (Especially if you tie them in bows, as shown in the manufacturer's own picture of the product in use).  In addition, as any parent of a babe-in-arms or an active toddler can tell you, a shopping cart cover should ideally be quickly and easily installable with one hand, as the other hand is often holding (or holding onto) your child.  It's very inconvenient to have to be fiddling with the fabric ties while holding onto a squirming child.  I would have returned this product to the store I bought it from, but by the time I actually got around to trying to use this cover, I'd lost the receipt.  So it's now sitting in storage, where it'll most likely stay until I throw it out.  (I decided against donating it because I think it's a less-than-safe product).Grade: D-</td>\n",

My son is 11 months old and before getting this vest, we usually just bundled him up as needed and tolerated the extra bulk from coats. As the weather got colder, I found that we were using the carrier less and worrying more about if he was warm enough while in it. I've used this now with both a Beco Butterfly and a Boba and it's worked well with both. We both stay toasty warm while wearing this and, even though I feel silly, I think it was worth purchasing.Sizing note: I'm 5'5\" and normally wear size 18/20 clothes.

You don't have to have 5 arms or be a contortionist to use it like you do with some of the cheaper carriers.  You can wear this carrier with the baby facing you or facing out.  However, it cannot be worn on your back like some carriers can.  My son loves this carrier.  I generally wear him in it around the house when I am trying to get things done and for short outings.  If I am going to be out for a while, I usually put him in the stroller b/c I find that to be more convenient.  My only problem is that now that he is almost 20 pounds it really weighs down on my shoulders and if I carry him in it for too long I am really sore.  However, it doesn't seem to bother my husband as much.  I had to wash it recently for the first time b/c my son spit up all over it and it held up great in the wash.  It is a very stylish, sturdy carrier that couldn't be easier to use.  It is an excellent choice.</td>\n",

You have to wash it several times, braid it... just really mess it up to &#34;break it in&#34; or its practically useless.It's still not completely broken in for us but we have wrapped 2x with it now and the first time was a complete FLOP.The second time we did a reinforced ruck tied tibetan, it worked better but the wrap itself is still hard to work w/ it because of the gauze material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "61959   I bought this product shortly after my baby girl was born, so she could use it when she was able to sit up on her own.  In theory, it seemed like a good idea ... On trips to the grocery store, my little-one could sit in the shopping cart and look around without me worrying about her getting her hands and mouth on the germy, gross shopping cart handles, etc.  In reality, however, this Eddie Bauer shopping cart cover turned out to be a huge disappointment.  First off, the product was packaged with the WRONG INSTRUCTIONS.  According to the enclosed user guide, in addition to the safety harness, this shopping cart cover is also supposed to have another strap that threads out of the back of the cover (just below the backrest), wraps around the shopping cart bars, and then wraps around your baby's waist to anchor the cover and your baby securely to the cart.  Well, the product I purchased didn't have this additional strap, or any holes in it for threading the strap through.  After half an hour of trying in vain to find this mysterious strap and thinking I was losing my mind, I called the manufacturer of the cover, Goldbug, Inc.  The customer service rep told me that the wrong instructions had been mistakenly shipped with some of these products, and that there was, in fact, no additional safety strap to secure the cover to the shopping cart.  The representative emailed me a copy of the correct instructions for the product, which state that the only way to attach the cover to the shopping cart is to use the fabric ties.The omission of a safety strap is a major design flaw in this product, since the fabric ties do a very poor job of keeping the cover or baby securely anchored to the shopping cart.  The cover slides around and feels very insecure.  Plus, an older baby can quickly figure out how to untie the ties, making the cover even less safe.  (Especially if you tie them in bows, as shown in the manufacturer's own picture of the product in use).  In addition, as any parent of a babe-in-arms or an active toddler can tell you, a shopping cart cover should ideally be quickly and easily installable with one hand, as the other hand is often holding (or holding onto) your child.  It's very inconvenient to have to be fiddling with the fabric ties while holding onto a squirming child.  I would have returned this product to the store I bought it from, but by the time I actually got around to trying to use this cover, I'd lost the receipt.  So it's now sitting in storage, where it'll most likely stay until I throw it out.  (I decided against donating it because I think it's a less-than-safe product).Grade: D-   \n",

       "55504   I don't think there's any other baby product that has made me feel as goofy as when I'm wearing this vest, but being able to be warm & have my son stay warm while in his carrier is worth the embarrassment. My son is 11 months old and before getting this vest, we usually just bundled him up as needed and tolerated the extra bulk from coats. As the weather got colder, I found that we were using the carrier less and worrying more about if he was warm enough while in it. I've used this now with both a Beco Butterfly and a Boba and it's worked well with both. We both stay toasty warm while wearing this and, even though I feel silly, I think it was worth purchasing.Sizing note: I'm 5'5\" and normally wear size 18/20 clothes. The size XL vest fits me perfectly. It also fits my taller and skinnier husband fairly well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "3408    This is a great carrier that is well worth the extra money it costs.  It is extremely user-friendly.  You don't have to have 5 arms or be a contortionist to use it like you do with some of the cheaper carriers.  You can wear this carrier with the baby facing you or facing out.  However, it cannot be worn on your back like some carriers can.  My son loves this carrier.  I generally wear him in it around the house when I am trying to get things done and for short outings.  If I am going to be out for a while, I usually put him in the stroller b/c I find that to be more convenient.  My only problem is that now that he is almost 20 pounds it really weighs down on my shoulders and if I carry him in it for too long I am really sore.  However, it doesn't seem to bother my husband as much.  I had to wash it recently for the first time b/c my son spit up all over it and it held up great in the wash.  It is a very stylish, sturdy carrier that couldn't be easier to use.  It is an excellent choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

I thought the leaks were normal. Now that we are in regular sized diapers I know that the leaks were not normal. The seams around the legs seem like they are unfinished so that the inner fabric touches whatever baby is wearing or sitting on. So even if the diaper doesn't drip pee it will always seep it. Some days (and often) baby went through a new change of clothes with every diaper change. The first time I just used one outfit all day long I thought it was a miracle. But no, thats how the diapers should work! I stripped the diapers and everything, but they always leaked. I currently use bigger size GroVia diapers along with several other brands and don't have a leak problem. It is obviously specific to the make and fit of the NEWBORN diapers. Horrible.We only bought GroVia brand for the newborn sized diapers. We currently use several brands of one-size diapers. I HIGHLY recommend buying several brands of both newborn and one-size diapers. The one-size can be too huge on a newborn. Its nice to have something that fits better for the first month or two. But GroVia newborn diapers leaked like crazy for us.

       "      <td>We got the Diaper Genie as a shower gift.  I think they were the first to come out with a diaper disposal system, since the name \"Diaper Genie\" is to diapers as Xerox is to copiers.Unfortunately, the Diaper Genie is a terribly designed product (this from an engineer).  It finally broke on us for good a couple of weeks ago.Enter the Diaper Dekor...This thing is really honestly and truly hands-free.  I'm serious.  You drop the diaper in and you're finished.As emptying it, it's as simple as trying to knots.  Trust me, it takes 30 seconds maximum to empty it.  We haven't had to load a new refill, since these refills last as long as 5 of the Diaper Genie refills.As for the great odor debate, we found it to be slightly less odiforous than the Diaper Genie.  Let's face it - leave dirty diapers in a warm room for a week or more, and it WILL smell.There IS one poor aspect to the Diaper Dekor - you'll read about it in every review...  The door that you open to empty it is NOT child resistant.  In reality, it is a child-magnet.I found a clean solution to the problem, but it is a shame we have to do this.  Go to Home Depot, and buy a roll of the BLUE painter's masking tape.  It is in the paint section, and looke like a roll of masking tape, but it's blue.  Buy the 1 1/2\" width.Put a strip over the recessed knob, and the kids won't be able to open the DIaper Dekor.  The reason you want the blue stuff is that it can be pulled off and WON'T leave any sticky.You could also simply put the Diaper Dekor on a shelf, and use your hand to open the top lid before dropping in a diaper.Either way, this gets 4 stars compared to the 0 star Diaper Genie.</td>\n",

Highly recommended product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "      <td>I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&amp;eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&amp;eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(WARNING- THIS IS AN IN DEPTH REVIEW.  IF YOU WANT A QUICK SUMMARY, SEE THE BOTTOM LINE  SECTION AT THE END)\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to test out a wide variety of skin care products from all types of companies.  I have used products from companies such as Lancome, Algenist, Christian Dior, La Prairie, Fresh, Chanel, L'Occitaine, Vichy, Tarte, L'Oreal, Olay, Aubrey Organics, Peter Lamas, and quite a few others. I have used products which are not natural in base and others which are all natural in base.  Every product promises to deliver smooth skin, firm youthful changes, wrinkles smoothed, and a variety of other anti-aging or healthy skin promises.\\n\\nSome of these products are stunning and work very quickly.  Other products take more time to begin to show- sometimes several purchases of product to get there.  Still other products never really do seem to deliver what they promise.\\n\\nWhen it comes to skin care, let's be honest here.  Not everyone reacts the same way to products.  That means that what works for me might not work for you.  However, as a makeup artist, I work with a variety of skin types, so I test and use products with not just my own skin in mind.\\n\\nWHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?\\nSkin &amp; Co Truffle Therapy cream comes in an amber jar with a gold lid.  The lid has a single liner in it (shiny cardboard) but does not have an inner lid that can be replaced like so many other brands do.  This only has a foam liner which peels off for the first use and you don't put it back.  It gets too messy.  The cream itself is medium in texture.  It is not thick and it is not runny.  It is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe cream has a definite coconut fragrance that is reminiscent of beach suntan lotions.  It also has a smokey tinge to it which is most likely from the truffles in it.  There are also \"cones\" (like dimethicone) which help to make the skin feel smoother.  Also there is no SPF in this cream which I am very happy about.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I will wear what I want.  If I don't want sunscreen, I don't want to be forced to wear it.\\n\\nONE SMALL PROBLEM\\nWhen I received this cream, I found it had leaked all over the jar and box.  Not too much was lost, but for the price, it was a bit frustrating to find it arriving like that.  It could be because it is summer and when it was shipped, perhaps it was in a hot location which caused this- as is very possible with many products when it is very hot out.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CREAM\\nI recently wrote a review on another Skin &amp; Co product that I tested&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;SKIN&amp;CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;.  At the time I did not have the cream nor did I know I would be testing it out.  So, when I tested this cream, I did it in a few ways.\\n\\nCREAM ALONE\\nI tested this cream alone without any serum of any kind under it.  My results were that the skin was smoothed and moisturized.  The level of moisture and smoothness, however, was not extraordinary.  The smoothness lasted most of the day and the moisture began to fade about mid afternoon.  I would say that this is medium to lightweight in nature when used alone.  I saw a gentle performance on the face, but nothing remarkable.\\n\\nCREAM AND SERUM\\nWhen I decided to compare the cream performance, I used it with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;SKIN&amp;CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the other side of my face and the difference was worth mentioning.  My skin felt MUCH smoother, MUCH more moisturized and the results lasted until the following morning.  I did see a bit more difference in the side where I used the cream with the serum.  My skin looked a little more glowy and a little more fresh and moisturized than the side with only the cream.  I also saw a light lift to the face as well.\\n\\nBoth uses leave the skin not greasy and it absorbs quickly, used with serum or not.  That is what makes it especially nice for summer.\\n\\nWHO IS THIS CREAM SUITED FOR?\\nI would say after my experience that this cream is great for summer use for even mature skin.  I am not sure about winter, as I am thinking that it might not be moisturizing enough for dry or mature skin.  There is no SPF in it WHICH I LOVE, so you can use whatever you want if you want sunscreen.  I would say that this cream is great for normal to oily skin (unless it is VERY oily) even in winter time.\\n\\nIf you have great needs for skin pick me up as far as wrinkles, brightness, sagging, and age spots, I don't think that this cream will be your miracle cream.  It is a good basic cream and when used with the serum, it is even nicer.  There is a light lift when used with the serum.  But it does not seem to reach the level of Lancome Absolue, Algenist Genius, Dior Capture or One or some of the other high end products which provide really quick differences within literally days.\\n\\nThis is more in line with the L'Occitaine, L'Oreal, Dior Hydra, Fresh, Aubrey Organics, and some of the other lines from the drugstore that I have tried that work nicely but not miraculously.\\n\\nThis Truffle Cream is definitely better than some skincare I have tried which did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\\nWhen used alone, this cream is a nice moisturizer for lightweight to medium moisture.  Not much change in the face (tested on a few faces with light lines and aging) but a little bit of a glow added and healthier look to the skin.  It is good to use under makeup as it provides a smooth finish, but it might not be enough for mature skin or very dry skin especially in winter.  It does absorb quite quickly leaving the skin ready and fresh for makeup in a good amount of time.\\n\\nUsed with the serum designed to go with it, the cream steps up a notch and I did see some mild changes to the skin which lasted a lot longer.  There is a glow with some line improvement on light lines leaving a nice glow to the skin. I also saw a light lift to the face after only a few days.  Again, however, with some people with aging signs and a need of a lot of lift and youthful appearance, this might not fit the bill for you.\\n\\nGreat for summer for most skin types and probably more for normal to lightly oily skin for winter, this cream (and serum too) are good for solid moisturizing, light anti aging benefits at a pretty good price compared to some lines of skin care.  It does have some natural ingredients in it.\\n\\nIf you find the scent of coconut at the beach not a positive thing, you might not like this.  It definitely has a coconut fragrance to it which has a deeper smokey tinge to it, and it does not fade fast.  This could be a problem for some, but for me, I have gotten used to it.  I actually like it for summer use.\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this four stars because I didn't see remarkable changes with it, but it is a good solid performer for moisturizing, light anti-aging  and lift benefits and skin care in the summer without sunscreen.  I wanted to really give it four and a half stars because even though it is not five stars, I still am thankful to have found a cream with no sunscreen in it that is good for summer and does a solid job of what it does do as listed above.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Oblagi sun shield with tint is rated at spf 50 providing excellent coverage for your sunbathing needs.  The addition of tint covers and blends evenly with most skin tones and does a good job that you may consider going makeup free for the day.  The product is very thin which is a good thing as it provides plenty of coverage without having to use to much.  The non greasy feel allows you to enjoy your day in the sun without feeling oily and uncomfortable.  The product itself is wonderful, but easily the most expensive that I have ever used.  For a large family this may not last more then several days especially after reapplying throughout the day.  To make the product last, you may consider only using this only for your face while using something less expensive for the rest of your body (or your family )  If cost is no object then this is certainly over if the most effective and useful sunscreens in the market.</td>\n",

       "184872  I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.

       "168717  I have used this Jane Iredale product now for 6 years.  Once introduced to it I fell in love with the appearance it gives your skin.  Does not flake or look drying on the skin.  Use with the stamping brush (bought separately) and stipple it onto your face with this brush.  It leaves no residue and makes your skin look like porcelain.  Just make sure you get the right color shade for your skin.  I am fair skin and this works great.

       "187359  Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation was thicker than I usually wear so that surprised me, but it went on smoothly and covered well.  The tint was perfect for me and the makeup looked so good.  It wasn't messy or difficult to put on.  It wore well throughout the day and since it's summer, oil from my skin didn't break through and look greasy.  I didn't need any more powder than the amount I put on in the morning after I apply foundation.  Great makeup l definitely buy again.

       "184946  (WARNING- THIS IS AN IN DEPTH REVIEW.  IF YOU WANT A QUICK SUMMARY, SEE THE BOTTOM LINE  SECTION AT THE END)\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to test out a wide variety of skin care products from all types of companies.  I have used products from companies such as Lancome, Algenist, Christian Dior, La Prairie, Fresh, Chanel, L'Occitaine, Vichy, Tarte, L'Oreal, Olay, Aubrey Organics, Peter Lamas, and quite a few others. I have used products which are not natural in base and others which are all natural in base.  Every product promises to deliver smooth skin, firm youthful changes, wrinkles smoothed, and a variety of other anti-aging or healthy skin promises.\\n\\nSome of these products are stunning and work very quickly.  Other products take more time to begin to show- sometimes several purchases of product to get there.  Still other products never really do seem to deliver what they promise.\\n\\nWhen it comes to skin care, let's be honest here.  Not everyone reacts the same way to products.  That means that what works for me might not work for you.  However, as a makeup artist, I work with a variety of skin types, so I test and use products with not just my own skin in mind.\\n\\nWHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?\\nSkin & Co Truffle Therapy cream comes in an amber jar with a gold lid.  The lid has a single liner in it (shiny cardboard) but does not have an inner lid that can be replaced like so many other brands do.  This only has a foam liner which peels off for the first use and you don't put it back.  It gets too messy.  The cream itself is medium in texture.  It is not thick and it is not runny.  It is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe cream has a definite coconut fragrance that is reminiscent of beach suntan lotions.  It also has a smokey tinge to it which is most likely from the truffles in it.  There are also \"cones\" (like dimethicone) which help to make the skin feel smoother.  Also there is no SPF in this cream which I am very happy about.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I will wear what I want.  If I don't want sunscreen, I don't want to be forced to wear it.\\n\\nONE SMALL PROBLEM\\nWhen I received this cream, I found it had leaked all over the jar and box.  Not too much was lost, but for the price, it was a bit frustrating to find it arriving like that.  It could be because it is summer and when it was shipped, perhaps it was in a hot location which caused this- as is very possible with many products when it is very hot out.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CREAM\\nI recently wrote a review on another Skin & Co product that I tested&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>.  At the time I did not have the cream nor did I know I would be testing it out.  So, when I tested this cream, I did it in a few ways.\\n\\nCREAM ALONE\\nI tested this cream alone without any serum of any kind under it.  My results were that the skin was smoothed and moisturized.  The level of moisture and smoothness, however, was not extraordinary.  The smoothness lasted most of the day and the moisture began to fade about mid afternoon.  I would say that this is medium to lightweight in nature when used alone.  I saw a gentle performance on the face, but nothing remarkable.\\n\\nCREAM AND SERUM\\nWhen I decided to compare the cream performance, I used it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;on the other side of my face and the difference was worth mentioning.  My skin felt MUCH smoother, MUCH more moisturized and the results lasted until the following morning.  I did see a bit more difference in the side where I used the cream with the serum.  My skin looked a little more glowy and a little more fresh and moisturized than the side with only the cream.  I also saw a light lift to the face as well.\\n\\nBoth uses leave the skin not greasy and it absorbs quickly, used with serum or not.  That is what makes it especially nice for summer.\\n\\nWHO IS THIS CREAM SUITED FOR?\\nI would say after my experience that this cream is great for summer use for even mature skin.  I am not sure about winter, as I am thinking that it might not be moisturizing enough for dry or mature skin.  There is no SPF in it WHICH I LOVE, so you can use whatever you want if you want sunscreen.  I would say that this cream is great for normal to oily skin (unless it is VERY oily) even in winter time.\\n\\nIf you have great needs for skin pick me up as far as wrinkles, brightness, sagging, and age spots, I don't think that this cream will be your miracle cream.  It is a good basic cream and when used with the serum, it is even nicer.  There is a light lift when used with the serum.  But it does not seem to reach the level of Lancome Absolue, Algenist Genius, Dior Capture or One or some of the other high end products which provide really quick differences within literally days.\\n\\nThis is more in line with the L'Occitaine, L'Oreal, Dior Hydra, Fresh, Aubrey Organics, and some of the other lines from the drugstore that I have tried that work nicely but not miraculously.\\n\\nThis Truffle Cream is definitely better than some skincare I have tried which did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\\nWhen used alone, this cream is a nice moisturizer for lightweight to medium moisture.  Not much change in the face (tested on a few faces with light lines and aging) but a little bit of a glow added and healthier look to the skin.  It is good to use under makeup as it provides a smooth finish, but it might not be enough for mature skin or very dry skin especially in winter.  It does absorb quite quickly leaving the skin ready and fresh for makeup in a good amount of time.\\n\\nUsed with the serum designed to go with it, the cream steps up a notch and I did see some mild changes to the skin which lasted a lot longer.  There is a glow with some line improvement on light lines leaving a nice glow to the skin. I also saw a light lift to the face after only a few days.  Again, however, with some people with aging signs and a need of a lot of lift and youthful appearance, this might not fit the bill for you.\\n\\nGreat for summer for most skin types and probably more for normal to lightly oily skin for winter, this cream (and serum too) are good for solid moisturizing, light anti aging benefits at a pretty good price compared to some lines of skin care.  It does have some natural ingredients in it.\\n\\nIf you find the scent of coconut at the beach not a positive thing, you might not like this.  It definitely has a coconut fragrance to it which has a deeper smokey tinge to it, and it does not fade fast.  This could be a problem for some, but for me, I have gotten used to it.  I actually like it for summer use.\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this four stars because I didn't see remarkable changes with it, but it is a good solid performer for moisturizing, light anti-aging  and lift benefits and skin care in the summer without sunscreen.  I wanted to really give it four and a half stars because even though it is not five stars, I still am thankful to have found a cream with no sunscreen in it that is good for summer and does a solid job of what it does do as listed above.   \n",
       "191601  The Oblagi sun shield with tint is rated at spf 50 providing excellent coverage for your sunbathing needs.  The addition of tint covers and blends evenly with most skin tones and does a good job that you may consider going makeup free for the day.  The product is very thin which is a good thing as it provides plenty of coverage without having to use to much.  The non greasy feel allows you to enjoy your day in the sun without feeling oily and uncomfortable.  The product itself is wonderful, but easily the most expensive that I have ever used.  For a large family this may not last more then several days especially after reapplying throughout the day.  To make the product last, you may consider only using this only for your face while using something less expensive for the rest of your body (or your family )  If cost is no object then this is certainly over if the most effective and useful sunscreens in the market.

       "202439  Well, I don't really know what else to say.. I ordered them for the guitar, Though I won't be using them for the banjo. (I prefer the sound of clawhammer banjo)The thumb picks fit my thumb perfectly, and the finger picks only needed a tiny squeeze to stay put. They feel kind of alien right now, as it's the first time I've ever wore finger picks, but I'll get used to them eventually :P.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "197360  The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

While you can't beat an electric double pump for efficiency, sometimes it's really nice to have a hand pump.  I chose this one simply because the valves, bottles, and breast shields are interchangeable with the ones for my electric pump, and it works just fine.  The pumping mechanism itself seems well designed so it's pretty comfortable to pump, even for my relatively small hands.  It's really easy to clean since the pumping part itself never comes in contact with milk.Having a great sleeper, I've struggled with engorgement, especially at night, and this hand pump has quickly become essential.  It's so much quieter and easier to set up than my electric pump that it's perfect for quick night-time relief.  The suction seems gentler than the electric pump so is more comfortable, but takes longer to fully drain the breast.  Since I'm not looking for full drainage or stimulation at night, this pump is perfect.  I've also used it while a passenger in a car and in various public restrooms when it's bulky electric big sister would be inconvenient.  Everything comes apart and is small enough to fit in a zip-lock sandwich bag (except the bottle).</td>\n",

       "17426   This is nothing against Amazon, but more so against Medela - I really wish you could have the choice of which size you get when you initially get the breastpump.  It's almost discriminatory against women with smaller or larger nipples!  I just had to order different sizes to find the right size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "13474   I waited four months before purchasing a hand pump, and wish I had done so sooner.  My insurance covered the full cost of the Medela Pump In Style, which I use daily while at work.  While you can't beat an electric double pump for efficiency, sometimes it's really nice to have a hand pump.  I chose this one simply because the valves, bottles, and breast shields are interchangeable with the ones for my electric pump, and it works just fine.  The pumping mechanism itself seems well designed so it's pretty comfortable to pump, even for my relatively small hands.  It's really easy to clean since the pumping part itself never comes in contact with milk.Having a great sleeper, I've struggled with engorgement, especially at night, and this hand pump has quickly become essential.  It's so much quieter and easier to set up than my electric pump that it's perfect for quick night-time relief.  The suction seems gentler than the electric pump so is more comfortable, but takes longer to fully drain the breast.  Since I'm not looking for full drainage or stimulation at night, this pump is perfect.  I've also used it while a passenger in a car and in various public restrooms when it's bulky electric big sister would be inconvenient.  Everything comes apart and is small enough to fit in a zip-lock sandwich bag (except the bottle).   \n",

The thermometer is really cheap and never worked, but that didn't bother me much since we already had a different ear thermometerBraun IRT 4020 ThermoScan Ear Thermometer.

Unfortunately, the polish chips easily, so you may want to use a good base coat (like China Glaze) first, then this polish, then a quality top coat (like Seche Vite).  Without the base coat and top coat, the Julep polish lasted less than a day on my nails.  After reapplying, this time with the base coat and top coat, it lasted a week before it started chipping.\\n\\nAnother thing I didn't like is the color.  On my monitor, the color (Alaina) looked like a lovely lavender.  On my nails, it's lavender mixed with gray.  Maybe if I were younger...  My husband called the color horrid.  I don't like the color any more than he does.  It might look pretty if you stamp your nails with a dark color over the Alaina.  By itself, not so much.</td>\n",

Yes, it is kind of expensive, but it does last and the colors are always fresh and beautiful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "21952   This grooming kit is easy to travel with, and convenient since everything is kept is kept in the clear hard plastic case.  The nail clippers, emery boards, and hair brush work really well.  The nasal aspirator is decent, but the one we received free from the hospital works better.  The thermometer is really cheap and never worked, but that didn't bother me much since we already had a different ear thermometerBraun IRT 4020 ThermoScan Ear Thermometer.  We  haven't used the medicine spoon, dropper, or swabs but I'm glad we have them on hand and accessible. This kit is less expensive than other kits, and overall I've been happy with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "185392  I don't like the tall bottle, which is easy to tip over while applying the polish.  It dries quickly.  Unfortunately, the polish chips easily, so you may want to use a good base coat (like China Glaze) first, then this polish, then a quality top coat (like Seche Vite).  Without the base coat and top coat, the Julep polish lasted less than a day on my nails.  After reapplying, this time with the base coat and top coat, it lasted a week before it started chipping.\\n\\nAnother thing I didn't like is the color.  On my monitor, the color (Alaina) looked like a lovely lavender.  On my nails, it's lavender mixed with gray.  Maybe if I were younger...  My husband called the color horrid.  I don't like the color any more than he does.  It might look pretty if you stamp your nails with a dark color over the Alaina.  By itself, not so much.   \n",

       "110181  I haven't used it yet, but just wanted to comment on assembly.  It was easy up to the point where you have to nail on the bassinet support base.  It took me some time to do that but after you get thru that step its easy again.  The bassinet looks good just like the pic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

These locks work great, as there is no external hardware. Now my son simply tries to open a cabinet and walks away when he realizes that it doesn't open.  There are two swithes on the lock that keep them locked or unlocked.  That works well when you don't want your cabinet to be locked at all times or if someone needs to babyproof their house on occasion, but not all of the time. I just stick the key to my fridge (magnet) so I won't lose it.  It does take some getting used to, as you can't see the lock from the outside of the cabinet to remind you it is there, but it sure does beat having to mess with external locks while trying to get into your cabinet.  I also like that the cabinet won't open the slightest bit while being pulled on, which keeps my son's fingers from getting pinched.  I would highly recommend this product.</td>\n",

There are two swithes on the lock that keep them locked or unlocked.  That works well when you don't want your cabinet to be locked at all times or if someone needs to babyproof their house on occasion, but not all of the time. I just stick the key to my fridge (magnet) so I won't lose it.  It does take some getting used to, as you can't see the lock from the outside of the cabinet to remind you it is there, but it sure does beat having to mess with external locks while trying to get into your cabinet.  I also like that the cabinet won't open the slightest bit while being pulled on, which keeps my son's fingers from getting pinched.  I would highly recommend this product.   \n",

The crib was packaged very well, no damage, and shipped very quickly!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

I read in other reviews before purchasing that the stackable screw-on containers were a difficult to screw on and off, I found that to be the case in the beginning but found out that you need to align the layer right on top of the bottom before screwing on.On days when I am not too sure how long I will be out I use all four containers, on days when I'm out only for a couple of hours I fill up only 1 layer and take it with me- having it in my diaper bag just incase really gives me a peace of mind as well. The funnel top makes it very easy to pour into bottles without any mess, I have found that when the bottle is filled to the top with water it can be very hard to pour all that formula powder into it but this would be the case whether you are using this dispenser or not, the trick is to simply use a big bottle opposed to the small bottle.Thus far the dispenser has served me well and I have no real complaints about it. I love it! And it would make a great snack container too when baby get old enough to actually eat them.</td>\n",

I soak my bottles in a large bowl using a combo of vinegar, baking soda, and water after which I use the brush to clean out the bottles, and the result is squeaky clean bottles and parts. The back of the brush has a short groove running down the center which my finger rests on when I'm using it to clean, it's a small detail but I notice that it makes it more comfortable to use.

       "      <td>We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.</td>\n",

And it would make a great snack container too when baby get old enough to actually eat them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "15720   The Philips AVENT Bottle Brush  has a thick cluster of bristles at the end which really help with scrubbing out the bottom of the bottles. I soak my bottles in a large bowl using a combo of vinegar, baking soda, and water after which I use the brush to clean out the bottles, and the result is squeaky clean bottles and parts. The back of the brush has a short groove running down the center which my finger rests on when I'm using it to clean, it's a small detail but I notice that it makes it more comfortable to use. I'm really happy with this purchase!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The bottle is not to wide the spout is spill proof but still has a good flow.plus thay have cute designs. the only con is that the replacement spout is expensive, i also have the munchkins sippy cup which was also great but those spots tear quicker and are cheap looking.so i prefer nuk!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "70779   We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.   \n",

I should've stopped while I was ahead, because the Body Blur Instant HD was a bit of a letdown.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong. It gives a decent color, particularly on the legs (my personal bete noire), although this was probably a bit dark for me. I found the application streaky, no matter what I did. And the idea of putting this on my face? Oh gawd, no!\\n\\nThe real problem with this is that it rubs off. I had this on my legs, hours before I went to bed, and it didn't feel tacky. In the morning I woke up to sheets with tan-colored smears, the product embeded in the fibers. I washed them immediately, but the stains remain. Well, at least I found something where this product sticks, cause it sure wasn't my legs!\\n\\nI wish I could recommend this more highly, but it's a disappointment.

       "192666  After trying several Vita Liberata tanning products, the last one I used had me raving with joy (that was the Fabulous Self Tanning Gradual Lotion - the best self tanner I've ever used.)  I should've stopped while I was ahead, because the Body Blur Instant HD was a bit of a letdown.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong. It gives a decent color, particularly on the legs (my personal bete noire), although this was probably a bit dark for me. I found the application streaky, no matter what I did. And the idea of putting this on my face? Oh gawd, no!\\n\\nThe real problem with this is that it rubs off. I had this on my legs, hours before I went to bed, and it didn't feel tacky. In the morning I woke up to sheets with tan-colored smears, the product embeded in the fibers. I washed them immediately, but the stains remain. Well, at least I found something where this product sticks, cause it sure wasn't my legs!\\n\\nI wish I could recommend this more highly, but it's a disappointment. Fortunately, the company's Fabulous Self Tanning Gradual Lotion IS available on Amazon. Drop this, and get that, you love it!   \n",

She even calms down when she sees the blanket or if she is fussy she stops once swaddled. My Mom (hard core old-fashioned skeptic) was so surprised to see this work, since then she is also recommending it to everyone. If I could give it more stars I would, I absolutely love it.

I highly recommend it, and it's great that it comes in this large size!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "93387   Good value, but doesn't always stay on the pillow, especially if my toddler has an active night of tossing and turning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "22672   Love love love love it! thanks to our pediatrician for recommending it we get an excellent night sleep (baby sleeps 9-10hrs since 1mo (when we bought the blanket), now at 4mo-she wakes up to eat twice a night but falls back to sleep as soon as she finished eating). our baby sleeps in it every night-no exceptions. She even calms down when she sees the blanket or if she is fussy she stops once swaddled. My Mom (hard core old-fashioned skeptic) was so surprised to see this work, since then she is also recommending it to everyone. If I could give it more stars I would, I absolutely love it. I'm keeping this to use it for my future kids, its just amazing.Thank you Miracle Blanket you are truly a miracle.   \n",
       "132263  This makes swaddling very quick and easy to do! It's nice that it is designed so you can do middle of the night diaper changes without unswaddling your baby's arms. I really think my babies did sleep more soundly for longer when swaddled since they didn't startle as much. This product kept my baby swaddled better than when I'd swaddle her with a regular baby blanket since my second child was a real wiggle worm when she slept. These are definitely a must have for new parents!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "38884   I don't know what it is about this brand, but it is by far my daughter's favorite.  We had received one as a gift when she was born and now that she's 8 months old, she is attached.  We had to find the brand and order another one so we can always have one ready to go.  My only advice is to buy at least 2 of these things - you will NOT want to find out what happens when one is missing and your little one needs to go to sleep!Definitely plan on buying these for our friends as gifts in the future - something about this brand is magic!                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

We ordered chocolate brown, and it has a very nice &#34;sheen&#34; to it as well--almost like a sateen sheet.  The only downside is that it does not fit around the mattress of our pack-n-play.  I measured before purchasing, and it seemed as though it should fit, however, there is a great deal of extra fabric.  It almost seems as if it would fit a much more thick mattress (maybe even up to 2-3 inches or so.)                                                                                                    \n",

       "124534  These washcloths have beautiful colors. They are not terry cloth and are rather thin, but will do for wiping dirty faces, hands and runny noses. They are small enough to fit several in your diaper bag with no problem.                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

The only issue I have with this warmer is the lid will pop open (All though I actually have 2 of them, and it does not happen on the other)                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "87727   Love this for swimsuits, dirty diapers, and as a bag within the diaper bag to fill with just a few diapers, wipes and diaper cream.  On a recent 5 hour airplane flight, we just kept this bag under the seat in front of us with changing necessities and a change of clothes for baby.  We were able to put the larger diaper bag in the overhead compartment and had a lot more leg room.   \n",

       "141129  This has been a life saver! I love how it has different setting and different speeds. My baby loves to lay in it and he will take naps in it as well. When he was first born I used it as a bassinet and put it next to my bed so that when he would get up at night to eat he was right there and after he got done eating he would fall right back asleep in it without me having to rock him. For moms who like their showers. GET THIS! I will put my 3 month old in it and I can take my normal shower and get ready without having to pick him up all the time or have him start whining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

When it arrived it was way to small.  I could not close the front.  I also reviewed how it is set up and it basically holds the pumps to your breast, so you don't want it too tight.  It could easily form a clogged duct with the amount of pressure if it was too tight.  So, I emailed the company and requested a return, I explained that I felt the sizing chart was off.  The company accepted my suggustion, said they would take a look at the sizing chart and they accepted my return.  I am giving 4 stars not for the product, I would give 3 stars especially for the price.  I'm sure this did not nearly cost this much to make, even if it is imported.  We design and import organic bibs and the mark up is a little greedy if you ask me, but I believe there is a certain percentage that Amazon needs to take.  However, I am giving it 4 stars for customer service.  Thanks for accepting my return.</td>\n",

       "86781  I bought a barely used pump off of a coworkers wife and I replaced everything but the motor.

       "78856  I ordered this off of amazon due to the reviews it has received.  I read the sizing chart and ordered according to the companies recommendations.  When it arrived it was way to small.  I could not close the front.  I also reviewed how it is set up and it basically holds the pumps to your breast, so you don't want it too tight.  It could easily form a clogged duct with the amount of pressure if it was too tight.  So, I emailed the company and requested a return, I explained that I felt the sizing chart was off.  The company accepted my suggustion, said they would take a look at the sizing chart and they accepted my return.  I am giving 4 stars not for the product, I would give 3 stars especially for the price.  I'm sure this did not nearly cost this much to make, even if it is imported.  We design and import organic bibs and the mark up is a little greedy if you ask me, but I believe there is a certain percentage that Amazon needs to take.  However, I am giving it 4 stars for customer service.  Thanks for accepting my return.   \n",
       "61674  Honestly, I don't know why you need the more expensive covers. I've used this for the last 3 months, and it works great. I trade it out with another I bought for the same price. Considering the boppy only gets used for so long, why pay $20-$25 for the other ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Not only does it help us to easily find the binky, but it also helps the binky to stay more upright when it drops, AND it helps the binky to stay in our babies' mouths. If they are upright, the added weight may help it fall out easier if they aren't sucking aggressively, but when sitting or laying down, it's just awesome.I love these! I don't know what I did without these with my other two kids!   \n",
       "40590   Great for Soothie Pacifiers and adorable as well!  Clips safely to a child's shirt so when they spit out the pacifier it doesn't disappear.  Haven't had any problems with our 7 mo taking the pacifier out.  Keeps him happy and us from having to run everywhere to retrieve pacifiers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "21952   This grooming kit is easy to travel with, and convenient since everything is kept is kept in the clear hard plastic case.  The nail clippers, emery boards, and hair brush work really well.  The nasal aspirator is decent, but the one we received free from the hospital works better.  The thermometer is really cheap and never worked, but that didn't bother me much since we already had a different ear thermometerBraun IRT 4020 ThermoScan Ear Thermometer.  We  haven't used the medicine spoon, dropper, or swabs but I'm glad we have them on hand and accessible. This kit is less expensive than other kits, and overall I've been happy with it.                                                                                                                          \n",
       "51121   I am very happy with this pacifier holder. The clip that holds the pacifier to the child is very secure and does not slip off of what it is clipped to. I have had issues with pacifier holders that only have a close-pin type clip that holds it to the child where it slips off. I would recommend this holder to anyone that does not want to have to keep cleaning pacifiers throughout the day because they keep falling on the floor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

I read in other reviews before purchasing that the stackable screw-on containers were a difficult to screw on and off, I found that to be the case in the beginning but found out that you need to align the layer right on top of the bottom before screwing on.On days when I am not too sure how long I will be out I use all four containers, on days when I'm out only for a couple of hours I fill up only 1 layer and take it with me- having it in my diaper bag just incase really gives me a peace of mind as well. The funnel top makes it very easy to pour into bottles without any mess, I have found that when the bottle is filled to the top with water it can be very hard to pour all that formula powder into it but this would be the case whether you are using this dispenser or not, the trick is to simply use a big bottle opposed to the small bottle.Thus far the dispenser has served me well and I have no real complaints about it. I love it! And it would make a great snack container too when baby get old enough to actually eat them.</td>\n",

The bottle is not to wide the spout is spill proof but still has a good flow.plus thay have cute designs. the only con is that the replacement spout is expensive, i also have the munchkins sippy cup which was also great but those spots tear quicker and are cheap looking.so i prefer nuk!</td>\n",

       "      <td>We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.</td>\n",

I'm really happy with this purchase!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The bottle is not to wide the spout is spill proof but still has a good flow.plus thay have cute designs. the only con is that the replacement spout is expensive, i also have the munchkins sippy cup which was also great but those spots tear quicker and are cheap looking.so i prefer nuk!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "70779   We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.   \n",

       "      <td>I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps &amp; a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a \"croap\" (cross between hard cream &amp; soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush &amp; the \"Marco method\" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower &amp; store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses &amp; fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most \"feminine\" between the green, red &amp; white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This stuff is kind thin and doesn't seem to give as smooth a shave as the regular proraso cream. The lighter smell is ok but it just doesn't lather well. I have sensitive skin and love Proraso's regular line of products but this white label \"sensitive skin\" line is too sensitive for me. I'll stick to the regular proraso line.\\n\\nSHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.</td>\n",

       "172864  I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a \"croap\" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the \"Marco method\" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most \"feminine\" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.                                                        \n",
       "171565  This stuff is kind thin and doesn't seem to give as smooth a shave as the regular proraso cream. The lighter smell is ok but it just doesn't lather well. I have sensitive skin and love Proraso's regular line of products but this white label \"sensitive skin\" line is too sensitive for me. I'll stick to the regular proraso line.\\n\\nSHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.   \n",
       "172703  I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.

Then break out your soap/cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try! If you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet.\\n\\nI hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference!

       "      <td>I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&amp;eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&amp;eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&amp;eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.</td>\n",

IF YOU WANT A QUICK SUMMARY, SEE THE BOTTOM LINE  SECTION AT THE END)\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to test out a wide variety of skin care products from all types of companies.  I have used products from companies such as Lancome, Algenist, Christian Dior, La Prairie, Fresh, Chanel, L'Occitaine, Vichy, Tarte, L'Oreal, Olay, Aubrey Organics, Peter Lamas, and quite a few others. I have used products which are not natural in base and others which are all natural in base.  Every product promises to deliver smooth skin, firm youthful changes, wrinkles smoothed, and a variety of other anti-aging or healthy skin promises.\\n\\nSome of these products are stunning and work very quickly.  Other products take more time to begin to show- sometimes several purchases of product to get there.  Still other products never really do seem to deliver what they promise.\\n\\nWhen it comes to skin care, let's be honest here.  Not everyone reacts the same way to products.  That means that what works for me might not work for you.  However, as a makeup artist, I work with a variety of skin types, so I test and use products with not just my own skin in mind.\\n\\nWHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?\\nSkin &amp; Co Truffle Therapy cream comes in an amber jar with a gold lid.  The lid has a single liner in it (shiny cardboard) but does not have an inner lid that can be replaced like so many other brands do.  This only has a foam liner which peels off for the first use and you don't put it back.  It gets too messy.  The cream itself is medium in texture.  It is not thick and it is not runny.  It is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe cream has a definite coconut fragrance that is reminiscent of beach suntan lotions.  It also has a smokey tinge to it which is most likely from the truffles in it.  There are also \"cones\" (like dimethicone) which help to make the skin feel smoother.  Also there is no SPF in this cream which I am very happy about.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I will wear what I want.  If I don't want sunscreen, I don't want to be forced to wear it.\\n\\nONE SMALL PROBLEM\\nWhen I received this cream, I found it had leaked all over the jar and box.  Not too much was lost, but for the price, it was a bit frustrating to find it arriving like that.  It could be because it is summer and when it was shipped, perhaps it was in a hot location which caused this- as is very possible with many products when it is very hot out.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CREAM\\nI recently wrote a review on another Skin &amp; Co product that I tested&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;SKIN&amp;CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;.  At the time I did not have the cream nor did I know I would be testing it out.  So, when I tested this cream, I did it in a few ways.\\n\\nCREAM ALONE\\nI tested this cream alone without any serum of any kind under it.  My results were that the skin was smoothed and moisturized.  The level of moisture and smoothness, however, was not extraordinary.  The smoothness lasted most of the day and the moisture began to fade about mid afternoon.  I would say that this is medium to lightweight in nature when used alone.  I saw a gentle performance on the face, but nothing remarkable.\\n\\nCREAM AND SERUM\\nWhen I decided to compare the cream performance, I used it with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;SKIN&amp;CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the other side of my face and the difference was worth mentioning.  My skin felt MUCH smoother, MUCH more moisturized and the results lasted until the following morning.  I did see a bit more difference in the side where I used the cream with the serum.  My skin looked a little more glowy and a little more fresh and moisturized than the side with only the cream.  I also saw a light lift to the face as well.\\n\\nBoth uses leave the skin not greasy and it absorbs quickly, used with serum or not.  That is what makes it especially nice for summer.\\n\\nWHO IS THIS CREAM SUITED FOR?\\nI would say after my experience that this cream is great for summer use for even mature skin.  I am not sure about winter, as I am thinking that it might not be moisturizing enough for dry or mature skin.  There is no SPF in it WHICH I LOVE, so you can use whatever you want if you want sunscreen.  I would say that this cream is great for normal to oily skin (unless it is VERY oily) even in winter time.\\n\\nIf you have great needs for skin pick me up as far as wrinkles, brightness, sagging, and age spots, I don't think that this cream will be your miracle cream.  It is a good basic cream and when used with the serum, it is even nicer.  There is a light lift when used with the serum.  But it does not seem to reach the level of Lancome Absolue, Algenist Genius, Dior Capture or One or some of the other high end products which provide really quick differences within literally days.\\n\\nThis is more in line with the L'Occitaine, L'Oreal, Dior Hydra, Fresh, Aubrey Organics, and some of the other lines from the drugstore that I have tried that work nicely but not miraculously.\\n\\nThis Truffle Cream is definitely better than some skincare I have tried which did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\\nWhen used alone, this cream is a nice moisturizer for lightweight to medium moisture.  Not much change in the face (tested on a few faces with light lines and aging) but a little bit of a glow added and healthier look to the skin.  It is good to use under makeup as it provides a smooth finish, but it might not be enough for mature skin or very dry skin especially in winter.  It does absorb quite quickly leaving the skin ready and fresh for makeup in a good amount of time.\\n\\nUsed with the serum designed to go with it, the cream steps up a notch and I did see some mild changes to the skin which lasted a lot longer.  There is a glow with some line improvement on light lines leaving a nice glow to the skin. I also saw a light lift to the face after only a few days.  Again, however, with some people with aging signs and a need of a lot of lift and youthful appearance, this might not fit the bill for you.\\n\\nGreat for summer for most skin types and probably more for normal to lightly oily skin for winter, this cream (and serum too) are good for solid moisturizing, light anti aging benefits at a pretty good price compared to some lines of skin care.  It does have some natural ingredients in it.\\n\\nIf you find the scent of coconut at the beach not a positive thing, you might not like this.  It definitely has a coconut fragrance to it which has a deeper smokey tinge to it, and it does not fade fast.  This could be a problem for some, but for me, I have gotten used to it.  I actually like it for summer use.\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this four stars because I didn't see remarkable changes with it, but it is a good solid performer for moisturizing, light anti-aging  and lift benefits and skin care in the summer without sunscreen.  I wanted to really give it four and a half stars because even though it is not five stars, I still am thankful to have found a cream with no sunscreen in it that is good for summer and does a solid job of what it does do as listed above.</td>\n",

       "184872  I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.\\n\\nI suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as \"daily moisturizer), the other products are \"deluxe sample sizes\" of Puret&eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.\\n\\nThe tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.\\n\\nAfter restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the \"deluxe trial size\" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the \"serum\" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.\\n\\nThe bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.\\n\\nIf you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.

       "169574  It initially does appear to give your hair a fuller look.  However, on closer look, it mainly falls to the scalp.  I didn't have problems with sweat or it staining my clothing, etc, but I didn't use it for too long for fear that people would notice that my scalp appeared black.  I have a slightly fuller head than typical guys that are looking at this product, but my hair is thin, and my scalp does show in brighter lighting.  I was hoping this product could disguise that.  In a sense, it does on passing glance or from a distance.

       "168717  I have used this Jane Iredale product now for 6 years.  Once introduced to it I fell in love with the appearance it gives your skin.  Does not flake or look drying on the skin.  Use with the stamping brush (bought separately) and stipple it onto your face with this brush.  It leaves no residue and makes your skin look like porcelain.  Just make sure you get the right color shade for your skin.  I am fair skin and this works great.

       "187359  Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation was thicker than I usually wear so that surprised me, but it went on smoothly and covered well.  The tint was perfect for me and the makeup looked so good.  It wasn't messy or difficult to put on.  It wore well throughout the day and since it's summer, oil from my skin didn't break through and look greasy.  I didn't need any more powder than the amount I put on in the morning after I apply foundation.  Great makeup l definitely buy again.

       "184946  (WARNING- THIS IS AN IN DEPTH REVIEW.  IF YOU WANT A QUICK SUMMARY, SEE THE BOTTOM LINE  SECTION AT THE END)\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to test out a wide variety of skin care products from all types of companies.  I have used products from companies such as Lancome, Algenist, Christian Dior, La Prairie, Fresh, Chanel, L'Occitaine, Vichy, Tarte, L'Oreal, Olay, Aubrey Organics, Peter Lamas, and quite a few others. I have used products which are not natural in base and others which are all natural in base.  Every product promises to deliver smooth skin, firm youthful changes, wrinkles smoothed, and a variety of other anti-aging or healthy skin promises.\\n\\nSome of these products are stunning and work very quickly.  Other products take more time to begin to show- sometimes several purchases of product to get there.  Still other products never really do seem to deliver what they promise.\\n\\nWhen it comes to skin care, let's be honest here.  Not everyone reacts the same way to products.  That means that what works for me might not work for you.  However, as a makeup artist, I work with a variety of skin types, so I test and use products with not just my own skin in mind.\\n\\nWHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?\\nSkin & Co Truffle Therapy cream comes in an amber jar with a gold lid.  The lid has a single liner in it (shiny cardboard) but does not have an inner lid that can be replaced like so many other brands do.  This only has a foam liner which peels off for the first use and you don't put it back.  It gets too messy.  The cream itself is medium in texture.  It is not thick and it is not runny.  It is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe cream has a definite coconut fragrance that is reminiscent of beach suntan lotions.  It also has a smokey tinge to it which is most likely from the truffles in it.  There are also \"cones\" (like dimethicone) which help to make the skin feel smoother.  Also there is no SPF in this cream which I am very happy about.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I will wear what I want.  If I don't want sunscreen, I don't want to be forced to wear it.\\n\\nONE SMALL PROBLEM\\nWhen I received this cream, I found it had leaked all over the jar and box.  Not too much was lost, but for the price, it was a bit frustrating to find it arriving like that.  It could be because it is summer and when it was shipped, perhaps it was in a hot location which caused this- as is very possible with many products when it is very hot out.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CREAM\\nI recently wrote a review on another Skin & Co product that I tested&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>.  At the time I did not have the cream nor did I know I would be testing it out.  So, when I tested this cream, I did it in a few ways.\\n\\nCREAM ALONE\\nI tested this cream alone without any serum of any kind under it.  My results were that the skin was smoothed and moisturized.  The level of moisture and smoothness, however, was not extraordinary.  The smoothness lasted most of the day and the moisture began to fade about mid afternoon.  I would say that this is medium to lightweight in nature when used alone.  I saw a gentle performance on the face, but nothing remarkable.\\n\\nCREAM AND SERUM\\nWhen I decided to compare the cream performance, I used it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;on the other side of my face and the difference was worth mentioning.  My skin felt MUCH smoother, MUCH more moisturized and the results lasted until the following morning.  I did see a bit more difference in the side where I used the cream with the serum.  My skin looked a little more glowy and a little more fresh and moisturized than the side with only the cream.  I also saw a light lift to the face as well.\\n\\nBoth uses leave the skin not greasy and it absorbs quickly, used with serum or not.  That is what makes it especially nice for summer.\\n\\nWHO IS THIS CREAM SUITED FOR?\\nI would say after my experience that this cream is great for summer use for even mature skin.  I am not sure about winter, as I am thinking that it might not be moisturizing enough for dry or mature skin.  There is no SPF in it WHICH I LOVE, so you can use whatever you want if you want sunscreen.  I would say that this cream is great for normal to oily skin (unless it is VERY oily) even in winter time.\\n\\nIf you have great needs for skin pick me up as far as wrinkles, brightness, sagging, and age spots, I don't think that this cream will be your miracle cream.  It is a good basic cream and when used with the serum, it is even nicer.  There is a light lift when used with the serum.  But it does not seem to reach the level of Lancome Absolue, Algenist Genius, Dior Capture or One or some of the other high end products which provide really quick differences within literally days.\\n\\nThis is more in line with the L'Occitaine, L'Oreal, Dior Hydra, Fresh, Aubrey Organics, and some of the other lines from the drugstore that I have tried that work nicely but not miraculously.\\n\\nThis Truffle Cream is definitely better than some skincare I have tried which did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\\nWhen used alone, this cream is a nice moisturizer for lightweight to medium moisture.  Not much change in the face (tested on a few faces with light lines and aging) but a little bit of a glow added and healthier look to the skin.  It is good to use under makeup as it provides a smooth finish, but it might not be enough for mature skin or very dry skin especially in winter.  It does absorb quite quickly leaving the skin ready and fresh for makeup in a good amount of time.\\n\\nUsed with the serum designed to go with it, the cream steps up a notch and I did see some mild changes to the skin which lasted a lot longer.  There is a glow with some line improvement on light lines leaving a nice glow to the skin. I also saw a light lift to the face after only a few days.  Again, however, with some people with aging signs and a need of a lot of lift and youthful appearance, this might not fit the bill for you.\\n\\nGreat for summer for most skin types and probably more for normal to lightly oily skin for winter, this cream (and serum too) are good for solid moisturizing, light anti aging benefits at a pretty good price compared to some lines of skin care.  It does have some natural ingredients in it.\\n\\nIf you find the scent of coconut at the beach not a positive thing, you might not like this.  It definitely has a coconut fragrance to it which has a deeper smokey tinge to it, and it does not fade fast.  This could be a problem for some, but for me, I have gotten used to it.  I actually like it for summer use.\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this four stars because I didn't see remarkable changes with it, but it is a good solid performer for moisturizing, light anti-aging  and lift benefits and skin care in the summer without sunscreen.  I wanted to really give it four and a half stars because even though it is not five stars, I still am thankful to have found a cream with no sunscreen in it that is good for summer and does a solid job of what it does do as listed above.   \n",
